"A stay meant for comfort quickly turns into distress due to torture-like treatment and consistently rude staff","1","2025-11","2025-11-15","I am writing to formally raise a serious concern regarding the extremely disappointing and unprofessional experience I had during my recent stay at Ira by Orchid, Mumbai. What was meant to be a smooth business trip turned into a stressful and unpleasant experience due to multiple service lapses and unacceptable behaviour from the staff. Despite having a fully prepaid booking and requesting early check-in well in advance via email, we were met with rude and dismissive responses from Mr. Hariharan and Ms. Bindiya upon arrival. While we understood that early check-in may not have been possible, the manner in which this was communicated was inappropriate. When we asked where we could wait, we were directed to an outdoor area referred to as a café, which was extremely unclean and not suitable for guests. After expressing our discomfort, we were informed that Room 205 was ready. However, the condition of the room was unacceptable—there was seepage on the walls, a strong odour, damaged flooring, and broken storage. It was evident that the room should not have been allotted to any guest. A hotel staff member even acknowledged that these issues had been reported earlier, yet the room was still assigned to us. The overall attitude from the staff, especially Mr. Hariharan, who repeatedly interrupted conversations and responded without logic or courtesy, added further frustration. When Mr. Sanjay inspected the room, he immediately recognised the concerns and arranged a change, for which we were grateful. However, the series of issues did not end there. My family came to visit me during the stay, and the night staff refused to allow them to enter the room, citing a policy that had never been communicated at the time of booking or check-in. This created additional distress and made us feel unwelcome. Furthermore, a simple coffee order took almost an hour to be delivered, requiring multiple follow-ups, and we were instructed to clear our food bill mid-stay rather than at checkout, which again reflected an unfriendly approach. Overall, the experience at your property resulted in avoidable stress, inconvenience, and a sense of harassment due to the lack of hospitality and professionalism displayed by several members of your team. I request that this matter be reviewed seriously and appropriate action be taken to ensure no guest is subjected to such treatment in the future. I also expect a formal response addressing the concerns raised.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d307086-r1039097240-IRA_By_Orchid_Mumbai_T2_International_Airport-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"570","834750132","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/31/c1/46/b4/happiness50992482531.jpg","570","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SahgalN","Neelu sahgal","8C38D0621C137E76462715FC3094FFE9",,,,,"SahgalN",,,,,,,,"Kurla Rd Near Chakala, Mumbai 400059 India","Mumbai","India","400059","Maharashtra","Kurla Rd","Near Chakala","307086","19.11175","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.87116","IRA By Orchid Mumbai T2 International Airport","5497","4.4","199","145","365","1073","3715","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d307086-Reviews-IRA_By_Orchid_Mumbai_T2_International_Airport-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","https://irahotels.com/mumbai.html"

"Clean and good","4","2024-12","2024-12-29","The rooms are what you expect, not too big or too small.Bathroom is clean. Amenities are minimal.Service is good.The staff are very helpful and courteous, always ready to do that extra bit. They gave me a small fridge on asking, at no extra charge. Room service is prompt and food is good.The only thing is that for an ordinary hotel food is expensive. Cup of tea  is  Rs 170 - which is way too much. If you order omlette or fried  eggs for breakfast, you have to order toast seperately! That's pretty silly!
There are places nearby for food and one can walk up. Eat outside instead of at the hotel if you don't want to pay the high rates. They arrange local taxi  for airport at regular rate- you should, however, tell them ahead and insist on a clean and ac taxi .","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r986930692-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1932","398979372","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/c7/f1/2c/geeta-m.jpg","1932","41","42","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeetaMadhavan","Geeta M","3CB3C1F6A7587D7D6CD35F1FB4F8876E",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","GeetaMadhavan",,"Revenue Management","1009989673","en","2025-05-28","West End Hotel","Dear Guest,

"Really in need of some real time check review","2","2021-09","2021-09-04","Well to begin with i had been here like a day before for a family stay, well as expected the hotel looks exterior well maintained, rustic, prime location but with not so great view.. 
As you walk in the place gets that vintage vibe, rustic interiors from victorian era, dimmed lights huge ceiling fans with decorative central.. Old fashioned sofa, a small corridor and small front desk.. The next to your left is this inhouse restaurant sorry the gourmet restaurant.. 
Well invisit view and exterior view 8/10..
The real review is when you enter the lobby to your room... 
You might feel like walking down some old constructed site along the lobby to those rooms.. And when you enter your desired room which was booked directly with the hotel wasn't ready, you enter and that tacky smell hits you hard as of the room kept shut for a long.. So be prepared to have bad sinusitis if your allergic to such aura around.. They runn ahead to put the ac on.. So that it gets cooler and then ventilated but that doesn't help at all let me bring to your notice firstly if somebody has booked with you, its your duty to keep the room well prepared, and ready for the guest.. Not when they walk your so appointed people (housekeeping guys) runn around to make it fit.. When i said we are family of three its well understood they should make third person bed ready, and worst thing is you dont occupy people into two occupancy area when you're charging the family for triple occupancy. . Bad.. 
Well then after calls and making a stern point we were alloted triple occupancy room.. Thats sad.. Truly.. I don't believ even after havng such great review from people i didn't expect such behavior.. Avoided.. 
Then let me come to interior average interiors just painted n kept as it is since ages so don't expect that what you see from the entrance lobby or outside you will be welcomed to something soo admirable.. 
Old furniture that get stuck, bed thats not at all comfortable.. Fully sloggd mattresses soo be prepared for bad backpain.. Pillows i don't think its even changed soo flat as if used since ages and to mke it littl comfortable you are given cushion pillows.. 
Now let me tell you something more horrible.. Washroom.. I mean i paid huge amount to be entering into a washroom thats tacky with leaking tap of jet spray.. Towels just kept on rack.. A single soap and clinic plus shampoo sachets.. Woww.. In times of covid is that wat hospitality you provide??? 
Well avoid.. Then comes the western seat.. Horrible the  seats are not even replaced soo dicy and shaky seat covers you wouldn't like to touch them ever.. Annoyed to the core.. 
Had to call house keeping guy and ask them to fix it.. Point is was that my job?? Why was my room not checked on regular terms before handling me the keys??? Disgusted.. More to come wait.. 
If you are staying here and come across the board we are open for buffet break fast lunch and dinner.. Do not expect the buffet you feel like a spread would be served.. I was handed some piece of paper with the menu written on it.. Like
Banana, tea/coffee, mendu vada or idli sambar or mini uttapa, then eggs, then bread toast, juices and so onn... 
N then was said to select and say.. M luke then why woudl i step in here wen i was to be asked to speak from that limited menu in my hand.. Arrgh.. Relax more to come.. I stayed calm n ordered.. When we get served remember even after you include breakfast in your stay you will be served the normal filter water.. Bcoz if you want mineral water remember even after including the bf in my stay i had to pay for a bottle of mineral water bcoz only filter water is included in you breakfast.. Woww... Thats truly unacceptable.. 
We quietly had our breakfast for our two daez stay.. N wer just wanting for it to end.. Bcoz more the hype the kitchen has in its guest directory for room service is way beyond any 5star hotel.. 800 for a simple chicken dish.. As we had no option fr our first day u wants to try on the menu.. So we went for nonveg.. Ordered some naan, roti, chicken tikka masala, n fried rice.. Tally of 1500 woww for something that wasn't tasty except the masala of chicken tilla bcoz chicken was undercooked.. N fried rice was tasted full of soda.. The quantity is poor very bad.. You pay soo much fr just a little quantity is unacceptable no matter its gourmet restaurant i do expect something as i wasn't there for free... Truly disappointed.. 
When it comes to housekeeping you call them n they say wll come after 15-20mins woww.... For the first time in my staycation history i found somebody talking to me in such a manner.. The guy comes.. To sweep the floor and clean the washroom.. N wen i ask him about my makin my bed he says that somebody else wl be coming..great i didn't knew housekeeping has segregation into working..

"Service with a smile: A gem in the heart of South Mumbai","5","2020-01","2020-02-18","West End Hotel has continued to retain the excellent service it started with many years ago. Yes, the property is old and the renovations taking place over the past couple of years drove many clients to different hotels. But I recommend giving this hotel a chance. They are located centrally on Marine Lines, close to many landmarks and major sights for tourists. The room rates are ridiculously reasonable (especially if you consider the personalized attendant service) and the in-house restaurant offers wonderful food, even customizing to suit your needs/food restrictions. 

I stayed at this hotel for over a month with my family in 2011 and did so again now in 2020 for the very same reason. Thanks to Mr. Arjun Ramani, Mr. Rahul Dolas, our personal attendants, Sandesh Jadhav, Bharat Patil, Jayant, Chandrakant, the various other helpers, the amazing restaurant managers Mr. Raghavan, Mr. Tanaji and staff, and the wonderful receptionists who always helped us out when needed.

"Average Hotel, Disappointing Experience","3","2020-02","2020-02-16","Liked · Staff were generally helpful, friendly and accommodating. Everything worked in the hotel. Shower and AC were good, beds were comfortable and the room clean. Room service was quick and efficient. Check in and check out went smoothly.

Disliked · We booked the family suite based on the pictures on booking.com. However, there was a DRASTIC difference between the room in the pictures and the room we were actually given. (Pictures attached for reference) We did not appreciate this, and while everything in the room was functional and worked properly, (shower and AC were good, beds were comfortable and the room was clean) we felt mislead. The room we got was actually quite old and dated and looked ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like the one in the pictures. When we asked the reception about this, what they told us was that there are 2 family suites, and one was refurbished (the one in the booking.com photos) while the other was not, and that the refurbished room was already booked. They made an effort to offer us another 2-bed room but it was not sufficient for our group in terms of bed / sleeping arrangements so we had to make due.

We purchased 5 cans of craft beer from a mall to take back home with and stored them in the fridge in the room during our stay. However on the 3rd day, one can was stolen from the fridge during the day while we were out. We weren't about to go to the police over a can of beer, however this was utterly disappointing and what was most troubling was no one took any responsibility for this or made any sort of effort to either replace the beer can or reduce the cost, despite us complaining to the front desk as soon as we realized, as well as prior to leaving. (This was a relatively expensive German craft beer and could not be purchased from any area nearby). Stealing, however small an item, is wrong on all levels and we were completely disappointed by this.

We had to be sure to either lock up every little thing we had, or carry things with us on our person whenever we left the room after this happened as we did not have the confidence or trust to leave things around the room.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r745597747-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1024","218397188","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/04/7a/04/taariq-amaan.jpg","1024","12","36","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taariq_Amaan","Taariq_Amaan","46EEB8CF0E75242838EE01A8582785DD",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","Taariq_Amaan",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"

"Not a 4 - Star","2","2019-12","2020-01-05","Where should I even begin, This hotel is not a 4-Star as it's listed. I wouldn't even give it a 2-Star.
We stayed for 3 nights, all they provided was complimentary water, no coffee or tea, no kettle, no ironing board in each room. Their sofa cum bed doesn't even open, when they say a room for 3 adults can fit 3 adults, it means 2 adults on one queen size bed.
They didn't have a fridge, very noisy locality. 
The only good thing about this place is that the Staff were very hospitable.
Don't think I would ever come back again here nor would recommend anyone to stay.

"Review of Our Stay at the Retreat members of Lions Club of Bombay Willingdon Crescent","5","2025-08","2025-08-24","We had a fantastic experience during our Lions Club of Bombay Willingdon Crescent picnic and stay at The Retreat. Right from the start, the hospitality was outstanding and the team went out of their way to make us feel comfortable.

A big thank you to Mr. Raghu, Chef Bhatt, Fathima, Felix, and Sandeep for their warm service and delicious food. The banquets and events team, especially Captains Raj and Manoj, made sure everything was well-organized and smooth. Special appreciation also to Arun Selvaraj and Mr. Krishnan for their wonderful support.

The combination of great food, excellent service, and such a caring team made our stay truly memorable. Highly recommend The Retreat for anyone looking for a relaxed and well-managed getaway!

"A Wonderful Stay with Warm Hospitality and Unique Local Charm","5","2025-07","2025-07-28","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre. What makes this place truly stand out is the exceptionally polite and courteous staff. It’s heartwarming to know that many of them are from the local fishing communities around the hotel, which brings a genuine sense of warmth and authenticity to the service. Their smiles and helpful attitude made my experience memorable and special.

The rooms are very comfortable, and if you opt for a higher category room, you’re in for a rare Bombay treat—you may catch the awe-inspiring sight of eagles soaring just outside your window! It’s magical and something that elevates the stay far above the usual city hotel experience.

The pool and health club facilities are simply fantastic—well-maintained, inviting, and perfect for relaxation or a refreshing workout. Every visit here feels like a recharge for my spiritual batteries.

Food and beverage options are good, though I do feel they have scope to improve. The encouraging part is that the management takes all feedback very seriously and strives to make constant improvements on this front.

All in all, The Retreat is much more than just a hotel—it’s a sanctuary of calm, with a caring team, unique local touches, and a serene environment. Always a comfortable, relaxed stay that leaves me feeling refreshed and recharged. Highly recommended!

A big thank you to the staff and a special mention to Rahil from the front desk and Felix from the coffee shop to make our stay near perfect!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r1021432743-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"4","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IndusMystic","IndusMystic","BBE5408578824EF4D6163BA83C002624",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","IndusMystic",,,,,,,,"Madh Island Marve Road Malad West, Mumbai 400061 India","Mumbai","India","400061","Maharashtra","Madh Island Marve Road","Malad West","655103","19.154104","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.78779","The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre","630","3.6","69","54","134","184","189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d655103-Reviews-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.retreat-mumbai.com"

"10/10 on everything!","5","2025-06","2025-06-18","The Retreat is an exceptional venue for a wide variety of events. I was here as part of a residential business workshop for 3 days. From the moment I stepped onto the property, the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. I had a late night check-in, and it was smoothly taken care of by the front office staff. 

The room was spotless, well maintained, spacious, and full of all the amenities you could possibly want. The housekeeping staff was very diligent and discrete in their duties - I was never disturbed and the room was still made spotless by the staff every day. 

The hall in which the workshop was held was easily accessible, spacious, and fit for the purpose of our gathering. Hotel staff was constantly available for any assistance during our workshop. The staff also regularly check in on us and kept us refreshed with tea, coffee, and snacks.

Coming to the food, I had high expectations considering my positive experience thus far, and I am pleased to say that my expectations were surpassed. We experienced the buffet service for 3 days, and each time they surprised us with new items on the menu. I tried vegetarian as well as non vegetarian options, and ALL of the items were super tasty. Hats off to the team! 

After work, I explored the property and felt that its an especially promising and fun getaway destination for families as well. I spent considerable time in the clubhouse playing table tennis and foosball (and there are other options like Billiards, carrom, swimming pool, volleyball, etc). You can also visit the beach during the day, it's hardly 2 minutes away by foot.

Extremely satisfied with my stay at The Retreat and I recommend it for business/solo travelers and families.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r1013576102-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trek68615384369","Trek68615384369","BE7BBD2DB7CD8EE51A410A867B250100",,,,,"Trek68615384369",,,,,,,,"Madh Island Marve Road Malad West, Mumbai 400061 India","Mumbai","India","400061","Maharashtra","Madh Island Marve Road","Malad West","655103","19.154104","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.78779","The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre","630","3.6","69","54","134","184","189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d655103-Reviews-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.retreat-mumbai.com"

"Retreat hotel experience was regret","5","2025-04","2025-05-02","Retreat hotel became regret with respect to road access , dry fish smell and not able to access pool because of crows , pigeon disturbance ( all birds take bath at the same pool ) 

We have check in to hotel 4 hours early whereas receptionist not considered to give early check in

Horrible road access  Malad mad marve road , no cabs will get so easily, neither hotel don’t help to get any cabs ,only auto rickshaws possible , road work is under progress in between huge traffic jam 

As far as the hotel concern it’s very good and clean , providing steam bath facilities etc excellent, accessibility is highly disappointing 

Food is super expensive as we don’t have any alternative near by , we have pay and have

Thank you for taking the time out to share the feedback on your stay experience.

It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback about cleanliness of our property, our team members and we are humbled by your gracious compliments.

 

In regards to the smell from  our exterior areas, as you must be aware the property is attached to a beach and near a fishing village hence occasionally there is smell from the sea. This is limited only in the exteriors and not in the rooms or interior areas.

 

Our curated menus are priced as per city standards of any other five-star deluxe hotel and we ensure the quality and quantity as per standards

We are committed to consistently providing warm and efficient services to all our guests and appreciative comments such as yours are most encouraging and will always be our greatest motivation.

We thank you for your patronage and we look forward to welcoming you back in the very near future.

"RELAXATION PARADISE","5","2024-03","2024-03-25","Best hotel if you want an out of city experience in the city itself . It is located away from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai , despite being in Mumbai .

1) Rooms - The rooms are very comfortable . Take the sea view option . It is approximately a thousand more , but worth the money . Again , first try for A wing , then B wing . View from A wing is the best . Avoid C wing , if possible ( view not the best ) . Try for higher floors 7 , 6 or 5 , else the coconut trees will block the sea view . If you are a big group , then request for interconnecting rooms in advance .

2) Food . Tangerine cafe is the 24 x 7 coffee shop . It is also the place for breakfast , lunch and dinner buffets . Oriental Bowl is the a la carte Chinese restaurant . When you book the stay , go for the MAP plan ( breakfast , 1 major meal - lunch or dinner , and afternoon tea ) . The hotel does not offer an AP plan ( all meals included ) . There is no nearby restaurant , so if you dont take the MAP plan , then you have to order A la carte from the hotels restaurants , which are on the higher side . Pro tip - There is a restaurant around 10 minutes drive from the hotel . Name of the restaurant is BOLLYWOOD STARS . They deliver meals to the hotel lobby , from where you can collect and eat in your room . Food is quite delicious and reasonably priced . Dont forget to tell Bollywood Stars to include cutlery ( wooden spoons and paper plates and bowls ) . Else you have to pay the Retreat for additional cutlery .

3) Service - Very very good service . If I could give them 6 stars , I would , but google allows only 5 stars . Mr. Ritesh Gupta
( Assistant front desk manager ) , was very professional and helpful . His promptness and efficiency ensured a smooth check in and enjoyable stay . Mr Felix , of the Tangerine Cafe was a superstar , who made our stay memorable with his attention and supervision . Mr Shon in the service staff of Tangerine Cafe , looked after us very nicely . I did not encounter a single rude staff . I found some guests talking to the hotel staff in a derogative manner and they got it back in the same tone . But if you are courteous and kind with the hotel staff , they will be the same , and will look after you nicely . Dont forget to hand out tips ( they deserve it ) .

4) Things to do - First the free activities . The huge pool and Jacuzzi . Beach is average ( full of strong fish smell , which sometimes can be smelt in the hotel open premises also for a few hours of the day ) . Try the Retreat Club games room which has many games . Go for the Steam bath ( after the swim , never before a swim ) . Beach volleyball , badminton , cycling . All these activities are free activities included in your stay . Spa is good ( paid activity) . Air Hockey and Billiards are reasonably priced . Spend maximum time inside the hotel . Nearby activities are not that great . Example Madh Fort ( you cant go inside without prior permission )

5) Location - It is located at a very remote part of Mumbai . Be sure to get there during daytime and leave during daytme . Incase of a car breakdown , it will be very difficult to get help after sunset . The nearby roads are not well lit during night. Taxis and autos are hard to find .

All in all , a very refreshing change from the fast paced Mumbai life.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r943847343-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaisatwani","Jai Satwani","4992274334A1C716997D4C85EA0C0F33",,,,,"jaisatwani",,,,,,,,"Madh Island Marve Road Malad West, Mumbai 400061 India","Mumbai","India","400061","Maharashtra","Madh Island Marve Road","Malad West","655103","19.154104","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.78779","The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre","630","3.6","69","54","134","184","189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d655103-Reviews-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.retreat-mumbai.com"

地點不錯，樓下附近吃東西算方便，走到Victoria Terminus火車站也不遠。坐計程車到Fort區和Colaba區都很近。

"Colonial Era guest house ; rooms don't have tea/coffee makers or mini-fridge","2","2019-07","2019-07-20","Can't imagine staying in any decent hotel in today's era that does not have either tea/coffee maker or mini-fridge. It had an in-room safe which was surprising. 
Absolutely retro colonial era hotel. Old worn out wooden furniture. Smell of dampness was unmistakable. 
The bathtub had a used soap bar. 
Rooms open with a physical key and you have to put the plastic keychain into socket to have power.
Cleanliness was good - bathroom was very clean and actually much better than the room itself. Absolutely nothing to look out to - infect cant even open curtains as you end up looking into people's apartments and vice versa.
Stairs are more user friendly than the aged elevators - one needs to open a door, then open a sliding grill and same procedure to close. So one does this twice for any one way trip. Far easier and faster to take the stairs.

The saving grace was the dining area - service there was good. 

Hotel has an all Male staff everywhere - most of them are middle aged and some certainly close to 60 yrs.

I didn't stay here by choice and certainly wouldn't do it in future","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r691301019-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452391513","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg","1200","353","277","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NS_chd","NS_chd","3044AFE36BE6AD5FF1619822FE726F58",,,,,"NS_chd",,"General Manager","691690898","en","2019-07-22","westendhotelmumbai","Dear Guest,

 

Thank you for taking time out to review West End. We regret that the hotel did not meet your expectations. We have room service/butler service round the clock & tea/coffee is available 24x7.

Mini-fridge is available on request for base category rooms & superior rooms already have mini-fridge.

 

Bathtub has liquid soap dispensers. We try to preserve heritage feel of hotel, that’s why the lifts are new but with caged door. In the monsoon little dampness is there & we do have dehumidifier to minimize dampness. Thank you for appreciating our cleanliness & restaurant service.

 

If you can give us another chance of serving you again. We will recommend you to try our newly renovated rooms & our team will make every effort to make your stay a happy one.

"Mrs Meetu Soni","5","2019-04","2019-06-13","West End is a truly exceptional hotel! The architecture is unique - one of the finest Art Deco buildings in the city. But it is the people which really make the place special. The hospitality of Mr Ramani, Rahul, Felix and the whole team is tremendous. West End is rare in that it has been family owned and managed for 70 years - meaning continuity of experience and commitment to values (which is so hard to find these days). The West End buffet at the Gourmet Restaurant is legendary - and with good reason. As is the historic Chez Nous snug bar. The food is consistently delicious and has a super range of classic dishes - both Indian and continental. It is near impossible to find larger rooms in Mumbai! Whether staying alone, with a family or large groups - West End will alway accommodate at a high quality and with attention detail. I can’t imagine travelling to Mumbai to stay anywhere else - it is a home away from home because of the people and their love of hospitality.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r681165424-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"2","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meetu108","Meetu Booker Soni","0CE0111E32A80045B906D81297807069",,,,,"Meetu108",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"

"The Victorian feel.","4","2018-09","2018-09-07","This place is a excellent location for any one seeking a reasonable, neat, clean. And comfortable place to stay. It was worth every penny spent.
It is in South Mumbai which is the bussiness hub of Mumbai.
People are good. The rooms are spacious and gives you the good old days feel.
Parking could have been easier had they kept a valet. As the space is there but needs a valet to utilise it to its optimum.
  The places to visit around this place would be the Marine drive across the railway line or Nariman point too would be a walking distance. So is the Gate way of India.
  No doubt a good choice.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r614734251-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452388761","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","1200","2","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmotiwala","drmotiwala","080EC27CF6D18DF2BF06E2BD9D6D2ECC",,"303883","Nashik, India","Nashik","drmotiwala",,"Manager","615660700","en","2018-09-11","WestEndHotel1948","Dear Guest,

It was wonderful to have you stay with us and thank you for choosing West End as your preferred hotel whilst in the city. Thank You for taking the time to review us on Trip Advisor and for sharing your experience.

We are delighted that you loved the Victorian architecture and grandeur coupled with modern day amenities. We have limited parking (16 Cars) in our compound & the watchman also does job of a valet by parking in our compound. When the parking is full we request that cars should be parked in the nearby pay & park.

We are pleased you loved the central location, spacious rooms. I am excited to mention your glowing comment with the entire team and I hope we have the pleasure of looking after you again in the near future.

Yours faithfully,

We really appreciate you taking the time to leave such a wonderful review of our hotel.

We are glad to know, that you like the contemporary feel you got from the property. We are trying to restore our property in such a way that it could take you back to the era of Bombay history. We’re so glad that you really enjoyed your stay and that you thought the rooms were spacious, clean & the services were perfect. We try our best to keep our food prices on the lower side, we charge Rs.475/- for Buffet Breakfast & Rs.650/- for Lunch or Dinner which is quite compatible price compared to other hotels in south Mumbai.

It was a pleasure to host you and we hope that you think of us when planning your next trip to Mumbai.

"LOCATION","3","2023-01","2023-03-05","Main advantage about this hotel in my view is the location, next to Dadar station and access to other parts of Mumbai.  To me the hotel  is probably graded as a 4 star because of the swimming pool.  The breakfast was more like 2 star service and the chef's not eager to accommodate hotel guests. The room keys did not function most of the time and we had to keep going back to the reception to validate them.  I would say security is concern as anyone walk in and have access to all the floors.  I felt they were stingy as they seem to control what essentials were given out.  Have given 3 star simply because the front desk manager Mr Abhimanyu Shedge had courtesy to sit down and hear out our concerns and apolosise.
We will probably stay here in future simply because of the location, as it is convenient to our needs.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d301496-r881040193-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"2","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28rp","28rp","70C04B8C1A6E7797B79B8A292307A73E",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","28rp",,"manager","915311623","en","2023-09-07","Ramee Guestline Dadar Hotel","Dear Guest,

It was a restaurant with great ambience, superb food, nice music & good service. I ordered for the Caribbean mocktail, which was a mix of Mango juice, pineapple n  other juices along with coconut milk. It was amazing, similar to pinacolade but with a twist. I ordered 2 starters which were,  mutton sheekh kebab and fish tikka. I was impressed by both of the starters,  they were soft n flavourful.  I really enjoyed it.  Next I ordered the Thai curry with prawns,  it was served along with rice. I also tried the butter chicken with garlic cheese Naan. I t tasted amazing.  I loved every thing I ordered here. Delicious food. Lastly I tried the dessert which was their house special kesar kulfi with falooda and this dessert was very well presented on paan leaves garnished with rose petals.

Followed by bad service and an awful, dinner and breakfast spread, the bread had fungus which the staff refused to acknowledge.

Staff member named Rahil at the reception was highly unprofessional and infact he is the one who urged me to write this review stating, please go ahead and write wherever, whatever you wish to.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r941662821-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonamr_13","Sonam R","340272164BC025945AFE629013194DFB",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","sonamr_13",,"General Manager","941768040","en","2024-03-11","The Retreat Hotel and  Convention Centre ","Dear Ms.Sonam, 

We would like to thank you for choosing our hotel as your accommodation choice and for taking the time to post a review about your experience. Re your feedback, whilst we apologize to you any inconvenience, we would like to state the following -

The hotel is located in a coastal fishing hamlet and the smell you refer to is prevalent at times.  

As you are aware your booking was coordinated by Mr Sudesh Tamhane. At the time of the booking there was no request made for interconnecting rooms and upon check-in (on 8-March), you asked for 8 sets of interconnecting rooms. Unfortunately, we could only offer you the 1 (one) vacant available set. 

You checked in at around 1730 hours, when the hi tea service was over and the service timings of this meal were communicated by email to Mr Tamhane during your booking time. 

Your group members bought their own alcoholic beverages to the hotel which is in order. However, you demanded that the same be served in a banquet venue or the lawns. It was explained to Mr Tamhane during booking time that service of liquor in any area outside the licensed areas, would need the procurement of a license in advance and that guests could consume their own liquor in their room only.  

We offer all our guests a standard buffet breakfast comprising of fruit juices, choice of cut fresh fruits, choice of cereals, assorted breakfast rolls, toast, eggs to order, dosa counter, apart from 3 Indian hot items, 2 continental items and other accompaniments. Should guests feel the need to order additional items (like sausages, meats, etc), they do order items on an a la carte basis. There was no fungus on bread and the same was acknowledged by the Restaurant Manager at that time. Whilst your feedback on the contents of the buffet are duly noted, this is one of the rare instances when we have received such feedback.

Your entire booking was coordinated by Mr.Tamhane and all do’s and don’ts were explained to him via email. Unfortunately it appears that these were not communicated by Mr Tamhane to the group, hence the negative experience that you encountered at the hotel and the hotel or its team cannot be held responsible for this. You would recall that your group member (Mr Ratan) used inappropriate language in the lobby in the presence of other guests for no fault of the hotel As you are aware, Mr Tamhane was unreachable during this interaction in the lobby (at around 1900 hrs).on 8 March.  

We are happy to share with you a copy of the email exchange with Mr Sudesh during the booking period.

We hope in the light of what is mentioned above, you would view the matter in the correct perspective and we stay committed to providing you with wonderful experiences!

Warm Regards

"Avoid at all costs! ","1","2023-10","2024-01-09","Staff at the door were great couldn't fault that however as soon as you get to the hotel door there is a very strong smell of fish which is really sickening.  Reception staff were ok just followed the script and charged us extra to have an extra bed for a child to stay with us even though tje bed didn't fit in the room booked ( no Invoixe given for this payment taken) so the child had to sleep in my bed whole night which was very uncomfortable as 3 people In 1 double bed was very uncomfortable.  I booked this hotel based on the pool and being on the beach but wasn't able to use either as the smell was worse and when questioned was told fish is being dried on tje beach by the locals so this was a waste as had to go back and had to check out as the smell was unbeatbale the room was old dated and very dusty and looked liked someone hadn't stayed or cleaned in a while). Picture aren't what it seems. Not worth the money as even getting a taxi from here was a nightmare due to the location being in the middle of nowhere ","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r932942563-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"3","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ferhinv","Ferhin V","42A7742C604F5A915D892EA9526239FA",,,,,"ferhinv",,,,,,,,"Madh Island Marve Road Malad West, Mumbai 400061 India","Mumbai","India","400061","Maharashtra","Madh Island Marve Road","Malad West","655103","19.154104","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.78779","The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre","630","3.6","69","54","134","184","189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d655103-Reviews-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.retreat-mumbai.com"
"Good stay for short one day get away","4","2023-12","2024-01-02","The hotel is a comfortable place to stay. The swimming pool is well maintained . Did not see a pool attendant for the 2 hrs we used the pool though.
 Archi at the check in was very welcoming and extremely quick to do her job. Was efficient at check out as well.

There was no information of the complimentary hi tea any where in our reservation confirmation also was not informed on arrival. Got to know the same by room service when I tried to order tea late afternoon.
Food overall quality is good. Had ala carte lunch in the coffee shop which was pretty good and service was brilliant. The (female) captain at the coffee shop was extremely courteous.
Ordered dinner from room service which was very good and served hot.
Manav was excellent at breakfast service.

Room HK-
Requested an HK staff for evening service when was near the elevator . She just got the bathroom touched up and placed fresh towels. It would be  a nice gesture to touch up the bed as well.

Wanted to meet the GM for a feedback on a safety issue which i had on mind. I was informed that he was not available and hence met the Lobby manager.
The glass table tops in the entire hotel ( guest rooms , coffee shop  etc) have extremely sharp edges. Considering  that you cater to so many families this is an  area of safety concern  with children around the hotel specifically the ones who are as tall as your table tops.

Never heard back from the GM on the feedback despite leaving back my credentials. not sure if feed back was taken constructively.

Over all good place to stay ","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r931988425-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","5","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lawrencemoniz","lawrencemoniz","1DAC402637153AAE1D4ADD3289EFA616",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","lawrencemoniz",,"General Manager","942604303","en","2024-03-17","The Retreat Hotel and  Convention Centre ","Dear Mr.Lawrence

"A property in decay - AVOID","1","2023-07","2023-07-15","I recall going to the Retreat 5 years back, much to my disappointment the property has now decayed to one of horror.

Be it the beach which is filled with garbage and dead animals, making it impossible to even take a stroll on; or the staff which rather than focusing on giving guests a good experience is focused on fleecing guests for every arbitrary reason possible. The rooms have enough dust to start a dust storm in merely patting the curtains and are akin to what one would find in a haunted mansion.

Sad to see a great property in Bombay decay to this extent into one which is little better than a budget guest house

Would urge all to stay away at all costs and not spend their valuable money at this nightmare of a property ","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r903351910-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452389098","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Discover17805589961","Discover17805589961","68163785F3B6B51211A55433519D4EAF",,,,,"Discover17805589961",,,,,,,,"Madh Island Marve Road Malad West, Mumbai 400061 India","Mumbai","India","400061","Maharashtra","Madh Island Marve Road","Malad West","655103","19.154104","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.78779","The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre","630","3.6","69","54","134","184","189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d655103-Reviews-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.retreat-mumbai.com"

Food is amazing. Try the Chinese for lunch and a hearty buffet at night. 

The staff is warm and helpful. Ask for Disha at the check in and you will be treated in the true definition of hospitality. Hospitality is about prioritizing client experience and not revenue, and who knows it better than Disha.

Staff Sanjeev at the restaurant had a never say die attitude willing to do beyond ordinary to accommodate our demands.

"Reliving the days of the Raaj","4","2017-12","2018-01-10","Set in the year 1941, this hotel is a true example of the old days of the British era mixed with modernization. I booked a suite for my family ( 3 of us ) but the suite turned out to be big enough for 5. The ceiling, furniture, crockeries, curtains, everything points to the history of the hotel. 

In fact, the elevator has an old-school lift guy who would not allow you to touch buttons. Coming to location, this hotel is located opposite to Bombay hospital. Walking distance from Marina Lines station. The street is busy with a lot of food vendor options and there's an Irani restaurant like 300 meters from the place, which serves amazing breakfast food. 

Staff? well again, the guys are old school. Old testimony as they say. The hotel staff will be happy if you tip them the day 1. My advice, don't save money on tips if you need the best of services. If you tip them nice they will treat you as kings and that's how it should be in a hotel. 

I paid around INR 8200/- for a suite ( with taxes ) 130$ for that kind of services were great.

"Staff great however Cleanliness & Food a real issue very disappointing at times","2","2017-10","2017-11-02","This hotel is under refurb however that should never effect the general hygeine or tidyness of rooms. When we drove up I was shocked , the younger reception staff seemed dis interested and it had a musty dejected feel to the whole place , Furniture and fittings were old and unclean.

Our room had all the curtains drawn when we pulled them back we realised why the outside area at the back of the hotel looked like a bomb site , the small juliet balconeys were covered in debris dust and pigeon droppings and seemed unstable , the doors and windows did not shut properly and there was such a bad damp musty smell i purchased air freshners from the nearby chemist shop which didnt help much.

There were bare wires ,musty wardrobes  adisgusting  filthy fridge , plaster falling off walls doors that didnt shut , ancient air con , damp patches and the rugs were covered in hair dust and stains this was in the best one as they showed us 4 others before we settled on it in desperation.

The line is old torn and stained the mattresses bulked out with sunlounger cushions so uncomfortable i gave up sleeping , The fans sounded like steam trains and everything was mucky dusty and old i was gobsmacked.

The windowless bar was musty but staff good , watch your bills my advice pay as u go dont book to your room there were a few wrong bills as people i saw checked out. 

Lifts wer old but worked ok but the one lift was out of action that led to queues at peak times.

Room service was cheap but hte flask brought with my coffee in looked like it had come from a building site it was filthy.

Food was ok they need more european choice for breakfast as apart from toast you had had it. 

All in all we stayed put because it was a good location , staff mostly very helpful but for the price which wasnt a budget price considering the hotels under renovation and had has lifts not working , rooms out of service etc was high for such a poor quality they need to address the cleaning/hygene  issues as even a newly renovated room if not cleaned properly will be dire in a few months. 

Replace dust mite infested curtains , upgrade linens and towels , sweep rooms thoroughly and if you cant clean mats dont have the in the rooms , Get rid of fridges they are a health hazard . replaster and make safe wiring. 

Offer better choices on the buffett and make sure drink tabs are sorted for customers
I wouldnt stay again","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r537908100-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"205","19820681","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/89/avatar010.jpg","205","212","444","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iluvhollibobs","iluvhollibobs","5368421C063AE6DAFACED97B9D62E596",,"186424","Worcester, United Kingdom","Worcester","iluvhollibobs",,"General Manager","539893871","en","2017-11-09","WestEndHotel1948","Dear Guest,
               
    Thank you for taking time out to review West End. You were part of wedding group of 100 people occupying 40 rooms. It was a British wedding from 20th October 2017 to 29th October 2017 chosen to be held in Mumbai than in any other part of the world. So it was a very prestigious booking for our hotel which is a heritage & economy hotel.
                   The couple Mr. Daniel & Ms. Kirsty were very excited & so were all of us at the West End to give all the guests our very best services. We tried our best but we are very sorry that we did not meet your expectation. Perhaps, it is due to renovation work which caused dust & noise. At the time of booking we had informed that the renovation is going on .Because of renovation work for the security reasons the Balcony were barricaded therefore couldn’t be used. We deeply regret the inconvenience caused to you. Your hosts had stayed here on 2 previous occasions & on the strength of those 2 comfortable visits they booked with us. We deeply regret the inconvenience caused to you & we thank you for your patience & understanding. Please stay with us in the future in our new hotel which will have high standard of hygiene, cleanliness & maintenance.  
                    We hope you will give us another chance to serve you in the future & thank you for appreciating our staff & location.

Yours Faithfully,

"Location & People !! ","3","2017-05","2017-05-10","On 24th April as my mother was unwell, on emergency we had to admit her to Bombay Hospital. As she was in ICU & there was no place to stay for patients relative in hospital, I checked into Hotel West End, which is just next door. I end up staying there for 2 weeks & only returned home on 6th May once my mother recovers completely & was discharged from Bombay Hospital. 
West End is located ""just"" for Bombay Hospital, so incase of any unfortunate situation where once' close one is admired in Bombay Hospital, this is THE place to stay. Location is also very good for those who want to visit Mumbai to see cricket match or have work in south Mumbai as Wankhede Stadium is just a stone throw away. And so is the marine drive, metro cinema, Flora fountain etc. 
The staff is really amazing, right from darbans to reception to lift to restaurant to house keeping ... very friendly and helpful staff. I must thank each & every one for making my stay comfortable. 
Property is almost 70 years old & certainly not been maintained to the mark. Needs renovation ""everywhere"" !! I have notice certain renovation work & hope that the management does complete make over of property. As it's a old property & not been maintained up to date, most of the time one doesn't find many people (guests) & that makes property dull !! 
Hope management will completely revamp the property & post that this property will regain its past glory!! 
Wishing all the staff a very good luck & thanks for all the support !!

But inside this good impression wasn't reflected, although the hotel was undergoing renovation. The reception looked tired and unstylish. We were taken to our room by the lift operator. The room was spacious but dated and needed a refurb. But it was clean. We did not use the restaurant however we did go in the bar and had a pleasant surprise. The service was wonderful and when we ordered drinks we were given a load of snacks too which were constantly refilled. This was more like a five star bar, cosy with friendly clientele.

"Pretty good choice","4","2016-12","2017-01-18","I stayed in the hotel in Dec-16 for a week, this is a very good choice in this area. 
Here is the summary:

Pros:
- Rooms are big and well lit, bright.
- Service is very good.
- Has an in-house restaurant, which functions well. 
- Next to Bombay hospital, in a market area where you will find everything
- Are is well connected, so you will get taxi/auto and cabs round the clock
- Very close to Nariman point, New marine lines local station, churchgate, shivaji park and other prime areas. 

Cons (mostly minor):
- Its a very crowded and busy area, so always noisy. The glass windows and doors reduce the noise upto a good level, still. 
- The building is pretty old, and has limited parking space
- The surroundings are not very pleasant, many people sleeping on footpath around the hotel. 
- Slightly overpriced, considering no free breakfast and internet
- Front desk staff can be more warm and welcoming (like the other staff)

Overall a very good choice in this area, for good service, excellent rooms and good connectivity.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r453233999-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"50","144535491","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/9d/6f/c3/shashanksharmablr.jpg","50","113","172","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShashankSharmaBlr","Shashank","5EF9E21D4CFB462F2197717F28A036FA",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","ShashankSharmaBlr",,"General Manager","453729345","en","2017-01-20","WestEndHotel1948","Dear Guest,

                   Thank you taking time out to review West End. Your organization is booking with us for last 25 years but We are very sorry to hear that you have not enjoyed your recent stay with us. We are a heritage property but we do have facilities like Wi-Fi & business center   We noticed that some hotel offer free Wi-Fi, while some charge for it.  We charge Wi-Fi at a very reasonable rate & We do have Room tariff inclusive of WI-FI too. I agree with the fact that you should have been welcomed with warmth and a smile by our Reception team.  Your feedback has been conveyed to the reception team & we will make sure you will have warmth & smooth check-inn in future.
 
              We have butler service on each other, therefore there are no tea/coffee maker in the rooms & tea/coffee is available 24x7.  Please give us another opportunity I am sure that we will provide excellent service which we are providing your organization for last 25 years.

"Disgraceful customer service","1","2016-12","2016-12-15","Arriving at 2am on a Friday night, we were greeted by the night manager informing us that our booking for 4 doubles had been downgraded to 2 rooms with 4 single beds (of which half were camp beds) in each. There was no apology and no acknowledgement that this was a less than ideal situation. They said this was due to renovation then, when pushed, due to 'an incident', then when pushed further 'people didn't check out' and then finally that they had overbooked.

Overbooking is understandable on occasion, but to be lied to several times on the reason for the change and to only be informed on arrival was outrageous service from the hotel. They said they had tried to contact us, but this was only at 6pm the same day when we were on a flight already and by this stage way too late for us to change. 

When we asked for a refund, they said that they can't do that as we booked online, failing to accept that what they were offering us was not the rooms we had paid for. The lack of acknowledgement from staff that our situation was unprofessional and after a long discussion only offering to give us free wifi as a refund wholly inadequate. 
Only through the online booking company were we ultimately able to get half refund for the first night's stay.

Compared to similar hotels in the price range in the area, the rooms were terrible and the 4 single beds they provided us not appropriate for a group including 2 couples. 

We were moved to 4 doubles the next day, but there was no apology or acknowledgement of the stress and inadequate service they provided to us.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r444397039-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"6","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyEng","AndyEng","D4BAA8CBCC142D903F50482B4E0711BE",,,,,"AndyEng",,"General Manager","445511138","en","2016-12-19","WestEndHotel1948","
Dear Guest
 
Thank you for taking the time to share your stay experience with us.
 
Please accept my sincere apologies for the problems you have encountered and the lack of empathy my team displayed upon your arrival. It is of the utmost importance to us that the service as well as the product afforded to our guests be of the highest standards.
 
I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to strengthen our associates customer service skills and have used your comments to coach my team on how we may better handle the rare occasions on when the hotel is overbooked.
 
We clearly failed in meeting your expectations and regretfully did not handle the situation in a caring manner. While you may have lost faith in the West End Hotel I sincerely hope you will give us another opportunity and contact me directly the next time your travels bring you back to Mumbai.
 
I look forward to the opportunity to restore your faith in us.
 

Warm regards,

Arjun Ramani

Dear Sir,
	Thank you for taking time to review West End. From October we have started the work of updating our hotel which is like a “heritage property”, 68 year old. It is among the first five hotels, built in Bombay. The main water tank is also been repaired & that may have let to less water pressure. We deeply regret the inconvenience caused to you.

Our Food & Bar prices are includes of all taxes (in the case of bar prices the tax is 26%) Many bars shows taxes separately. We include taxes so that all our customers (especially foreign costumers) should know what they have to finally pay.

We thank you for appreciating our cuisine, service & the spaciousness of our rooms.

We thank you for staying with us & hope you will stay with us in the near future also & review our Updated West End.

Thanks & regards,

The breakfast is a good spread - make sure to try the poori/aloo and poha, they were very well made. The staff are courteous and willing to help.
Do not expect any luxury or frills whatsoever. At its current rate, the hotel packs in good value for money in a city where rent and food are a great strain on the wallet otherwise.

Phone stops working, no basic amenities in washroom. You can easily hear people chatting in other room, so noise isolation. They will not provide extra water bottles after 2 small 500ml bottles.

"WORST EXPERIENCE WHILE STAY","1","2022-06","2022-06-28","Mr Dinesh ji

My stay wasn't so pleasant as you mentioned in your letter. Not only me, numerous customers were so upset with your staff. here i would like to share my experience

1)  As soon as we arrived at your hotel @ 11.45 am, I tried to give an introduction, instead of giving me time to say one Mr Dilip arrogantly says that dont stand here go outside & do come after 2.pm as your check in time. Now you just imagine a person along with his entire family came to your hotel's reception for a booked room for which complete payment is being made. After Dilip one dark complexion staff who is supposed to be a reception he started his arrogance, literally my family asked to move from your hotel & let us try any other one but unfortunately we could do cause already payment being made. Very hopeless room service, as per booking no extra bed being provided by your staff for that too they behaved very badly. when we were leaving your hotel & about to check out at that merely for Tip all the waiters came to us started asking for the same. And in the end at the time of billing my gst no not being taken, when i tried to bring to his notice why you have not mentioned my GST  on bill no proper reply from staff then i showed them i have already shared on whatsapp no of Mr Dinesh ji. 
If you really wanted to improve your staff's behaviour with customer you need to go & see CCTV footage my check in - check out 
I will never ever in my life come back to your hotel again.
AS far as eatery Hotel Rasoi is concerned breakfast was good & Rasoi's  staff was also polite & graceful
thanks

The entire experience from check in to checkout was smooth! 
Ms. Disha from reception ensured we had a quick check in and she even helped us to get rooms which were interconnected since we had booked 2 rooms.
The food was scrumptious and had a variety of options. 
They have 2 restaurants which are a bit pricey but thats what you would expect from a 3-5/4 star property. 

The hospitality was impeccable as each and every staff ensured our stay was comfortable.
Will definitely visit again!

P.S: The property is near the beach and has a strong smell of dry fish outside the property. However, once inside there is so smell.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r891540509-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"50","154285179","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/32/34/7b/sandynair09.jpg","50","7","102","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandynair09","Sandynair09","D8783354F276F9D61F402B9DB00F3F7F",,"294191","Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar","Yangon (Rangoon)","Sandynair09",,"General Manager","893314246","en","2023-06-03","The Retreat Hotel and  Convention Centre ","Dear Guest

"Disappointing hotel..no old world charm in a business area","1","2016-07","2016-07-21","Was not given a good room, request for change for rejected.  The rooms balcony overlooked a dilapidated building.  Room was smelly, dirty carpet, frayed cushion covers, broken chairs, smelly cupboards.  Definitely the room was very big in size, but whats the use, if you don't want to use every part of the room, being so rotten. Seems they have renovated bathrooms.  It was the best place inside the room.  The Veg breakfast was poor, even tea was peculiar which I didn't like.  Hence, after that I even had morning tea outside the hotel.  Recommended only if you have work in that area and have no other option.  Which unfortunately was my case.

Does not exude the old world charm at all.

Check in was smooth. But managers lack professionalism. Lobby was attractive but rooms were of vintage style. 
Being a 4 star property room and bathroom both lacked basic amenities like tea-coffee maker, mini bar. There was only a shampoo pouch in the bathroom.
I was shocked to know that WiFi was chargeable. 
Rooms were big enough, room service was quick. location is wonderful.
But not value for money at all. They charged more than 4000 per night only for room.

"Royal Colonial Treat","3","2016-05","2016-05-22","Pros: 
•	The Colonial atmosphere.
•	Extra courteous staff.
•	Location – proximity to CST, Fashion Street, Gateway of India, Taj Hotel, Colaba Causeway
•	Nearby cinemas.
•	Decent food.

Cons: 
•	Doors that don’t lock.
•	Dangerously slippery bath.
•	No free Wi-Fi (even paid is not up to the mark).
•	No swimming pool.
•	No gym.

The moment I landed inside I felt as if I’ve taken a time machine and travelled 50 years back to enjoy the colonial hospitality. Every bit of this hotel reeks colonial. 

Established in 1948, the hotel management has probably taken special care to ensure that the people who stay here feel so. 

Be it the buildings, dark corridors, double door (inside & outside) lifts that need operators, antique tables and chairs, mirrors, shelves, extra-long sofas, and even the external electrical wiring remind us of the pre / post-independence era. And have you found a Coin-operated phone anywhere these days? And a Phone Tariff card that reads out separate rates for local calls & STD calls ?!? I’m not sure to which era they belong, and whether anyone uses these facilities !!!

What more, even the shortfalls of the hotel like leaking taps and creaking lifts, and the odour in the room till A/C  cools to its full level remind us of 1950s. 

But then you’ll definitely enjoy if you don’t mind these. Where will you find people run to you and ask whether you want something, the moment you step out of your room? And where will you find them asking every time whether your room should be cleaned? Where will you find a person in coat & suite running out to operate a lift for you? You really feel ROYAL in West End. 

On the downside, some people feel this is on a bit expensive side. Add to this you do not have a pool or a gym, you need to buy cards to enable Wi-Fi & that connects to only one gadget, the not so great (but not bad too) food all add to the negative side. Also, the proximity (almost the same compound) to the ever busy Bombay Hospital, rushing ambulances, and bee-line of beggars all decimate the charm of the hotel. 

However, my only complaint about West End was the bath. They’ve tried modernising the bath, and in course of this action they’ve used super polished black granite in the bath which neither reveals the wetness nor helps us balance. Every time I came out of the shower, during the five day stay here, only I know how many gymnastics I had to learn to keep my head and limbs intact. God these bath rooms can directly throw into the next compound (pun intended). 

I hope they do something about it before someone is really harmed.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r375522821-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"2348","362971214","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/a2/80/4e/avatar.jpg","2348","89","106","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaikris75","South Indian Gypsy","11339E312959E4C451BCA162C31EEDDF",,"297675","Coimbatore, India","Coimbatore","jaikris75",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"

"Decent Hotel","4","2016-04","2016-04-26","I stayed at the West End in Mumbai for one day. I was on a business trip and the location of my meeting was within walking distance to the hotel. This influenced my choice of a hotel. The West End was decent and good value for money. The building is old but is fairly well maintained. The bathrooms have been re-done and are modern enough (even if a little small). It is right next to Bombay hospital, on a busy little road, but the noise level wasn't much (maybe because I had a back-facing room away from the street). 

As I entered the room, it smelled a little musty because it had not been aired. It was a corner single room and no air circulation. But once I turned on the AC and the fan, it was fine. Perhaps they can air the room in advance if they are expecting a guest and know they will be allotting the room. 

Everything else was utility driven and adequate.  Room service was quick; the buffet breakfast was fine, with variety and sufficient for anyone's needs, and attentive restaurant personnel. 

Generally no complaints - except one: which I pointed out to the front desk: if we buy a 300 Rs. coupon for wifi (for one day), it allows us to log in to only one device. So if I want to use my laptop, I have to logout of the phone and vice versa. I suggested that they ask their vendor to allow multiple devices with the same coupon code (since we use more than one device most of the time!). In many other hotels we stay in, we get FREE wifi service with check in. Here, not only we had to pay (Per hour or per day), but it was restricted to one device at a time. Maybe they can work on this.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r368026978-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452389422","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","1200","2","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LRa0","LRa0","AF561631E2AB28B483D5A754437D37ED",,"293860","India","India","LRa0",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"

Wifi is available in the rooms but, unfortunately, it is not free.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r362297100-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452388198","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","1","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterdF4907GC","Peter D","CC0BBE02B06463D7CFDEFED26081495B",,,,,"peterdF4907GC",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"
"As much as possible, will not recommend this hotel","2","2016-03","2016-04-02","First, I stayed here for four nights for a meeting. This hotel was chosen by the local organizer of the meeting I am attending.
I'm thinking of a good way to describe this hotel before stating my reasons for rating it as a poor hotel, but I only got two positive comments about this hotel. The food is good and the hotel staff are accommodating. The negative sides would be: (1) hotel is a bit expensive though it doesn't offer the same comfort as the price you paid; (2) pictures shown in their website are photos of what it looked like when it was new (I think so) but now it's really old, you can tell from the old-school elevator and unchanged carpet, my friend was even bitten by a bug the first night she stayed in here; (3) I don't know how they clean the hotel room, but you can tell that they are not cleaning it well because when I lifted the bed sheets, there are stills dusts and dirt which they didn't bother to clean, I got really itchy sometimes (4) WiFi is expensive! this was the main problem actually, you have to buy WiFi which costs over one dollar for only half an hour and five to six dollars for seven or eight hours of WiFi access consumable for 24 hours (while other hotel will offer it to you for free) (5) Does not have enough amenities, no kettle as I would usually eat cup noodles if I get lazy to grab some dinner outside since we don't have dinner inside the hotel, and also as soon as I heard that my friend was bitten by a bug I asked for a pair of slippers but they said that they do not have that kind of amenities (6) I think I already mentioned that the hotel is old-school, but aside from that you will most likely experience getting pissed off opening the door using your key 
I totally laughed when I saw 4-5 ratings of this hotel, I don't why but I hope they are totally legit. But to others who are thinking of staying at this hotel, think again my friend!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r360849538-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452389216","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505danicam","Danica M","69E682B78C97E16B9E5085F275DC92D7",,"298573","Manila, Philippines","Manila","505danicam",,"General Manager","361939744","en","2016-04-05","WestEndHotel1948","Dear Guest,

Thank you for taking time out to review your recent stay at West End. It is through feedback such as yours that we are able to maintain and improve the services that we provide to our valued guests for more than 60 years.

1)  Your accommodation was booked by your local organizers who had been having similar conferences for last 04 years. It is a negotiated good tariff since the organizers are coming to us for last 04 years. So we have charged you a special low tariff.

2) We note that you are unhappy with the housekeeping & the housekeeping team will make greater efforts in future. Perhaps an instant feedback to room service or reception during your stay could have solved the issue. 

3) You feel that other hotels give WIFI free, we have studied the hotels in south Mumbai. Some give WIFI free(Included in the tariff, nothing is free in the world) & others charge if used. If you share your email ID with us we can email you WIFi charges of most hotels in South Mumbai

4) On each floor we have butler service & he can take any orders you give, even if it is just some hot water. We thank you for appreciating our food quality & saying that our staff are very accommodating.

5) We are an old hotel built in 1948 & we try our best to maintain it like a heritage hotel. The lifts are old but they are very functional & at all times manned with a liftman. Our ratings as per Tripadvisor is 3 n half stars.

If you and your friends stay with us, we will make every effort to see that your stay is happy stay.

"3rd Stay....!!! The Best in Dadar !!! Mighty thanks to all staff.","5","2019-11","2020-01-23","Hello to all readers and to all staff @ Trip !
I stayed at Ramee Guestline Dadar twice in a span of 10 days. 
First stay - 30th Nov to 3rd Dec- Suite room 202 ( I hope this the correct room number), 
Second stay - 8th Dec to 10th Dec 2019 - Suite room 102. Both my stay experiences were perfect. I was well looked after by all the staff. That is best part. They took care of all my possible needs. Both suite rooms were very comfortable. I have reviewed this hotel twice before and the quality of rooms / staff service is still maintained at the top. All amenities are in the room . The breakfast was a decent spread with a live cooking station. I was eating out most of the times and went light on the brekkie. I had a late night meal in the restaurant twice with friends and the non-vegetarian food was very very good. We had goat curry , seer fish fry and rotis. Everything was cooked very well with adequate spice level. I usually stay in Dadar for most purposes.....friends , food , local travel, shopping etc . This is where I will stay...
.... always !!
Once again, a big thanks to all staff - transport , concierge , front desk reception , restaurant staff , bar staff , room service staff, room cleaning staff and security staff. A big thanks to Saheeli , Aziz , Kamal , Sohail , Frank , Bala , Nikhil , Sagar and to everyone whose names I have missed to mention. I will return .

"A hotel which felt more like home","5","2019-11","2019-11-27","Stayed at this hotel for a good 5 nights in 2 different rooms.  Attended a conference at Tata memorial. The room we had booked was full and being only 2 girls we were upgraded to the suite. The room was spacious and comfortable. 2 nights later my husband joined me and we moved into the double room. This room was also very spacious. Despite looking all run down from the outside the interior was very well maintained. The room service menu was extensive. If theres one dish to try you should definitely try the lamb shank pulao. We kept coming back for this despite moving hotels. The staff were all so friendly. Ever ready to help us. Giving us suggestions for shopping and places to visit. Everyone had such big smiles it was so hard to say goodbye. We didnt feel like we were strangers. The only downside about staying in this hotel is the fact that its right next to a heavy traffic flow. You can keep hearing honking through the night and day. It never stops. We stayed on the first floor in the suite. The honks were very loud but still manageable. Thereafter we moved to the 4th floor. The honks were very faint. So I'd suggest to ask for a high floor during check in. Definitely coming back.

"Back again ...2nd visit..The best in Dadar , for sure !!!","5","2018-12","2018-12-28","Season's greetings to everyone and to all staff@Trip.
I stayed here on 17th Dec with late check out next day. I reserved the room at the hotel website directly. The hotel website quoted cheaper than the cost advertised on online travel engines. I also requested for airport pickup . My flight was 2 hours late and I called the hotel front desk to make them aware. The hotel cab person  called me as soon as my flight landed. He asked me to arrive at a pick up point. It took a while for him to get to me, but he got there eventually. Waiting time was approx 25 mins. From there , he drove through traffic , a lot of short cuts and I reached the hotel in 35-40 mins. So well done to him. I was happy to see familiar faces at the front desk and check was super smooth. I was given room 306 on the third floor. A big clean room with everything and anything. You name it and its there !. A medium sized toilet with shower in a tub. The room was quiet, bed was comfy and AirCon was brilliant. It was around 27 degs daytime in Mumbai. I had to meet a couple of people and the ease of transport around the hotel...its excellent. Every provision...ATM / medics / banks/ stores / restros / tuk tuk / taxis ....etc all within 10 min walking distance. The hotel is close to Siddhivinayak Temple ...20 min by taxi. This is the main reason I stay here. No banging disco's...no noise...Good food, good bed and so good sleep. I requested dinner as room service...Goat curry / rotis / salad..!! perfectly spiced and cooked. The second time....I had a great stay here. The staff here are jovial , professional & hardworking .....no doubt ! I was well taken care of. I requested late check out next day. I paid extra and was given a free airport drop in the afternoon. Thanks to all staff and front desk ..!! I will return. My stay cost with food/drinks was approx £110.
If in Dadar east .....It has to be Ramee !!

Идеальное расположение, как для перемещений на такси, так и на метро, до которого идти пешком 1-2 минуты. В шаговой доступности есть торговые улицы со всеми необходимыми туристу магазинами, которые работают даже поздно вечером и ночью.  Приятным бонусом был бесплатный трансфер до аэропорта.

I guess reception staff (AMIT) was lying.

Some facility feedback for the property managers,

The phones lines need to be looked at. Comms is important when there is a large family around. Mobile networks are poor here.

The air conditioning thermostats need and uprade or repairs. Its either gets too chilly or too hot/stuffy.

"Wifi 500 rs. Charge for 1 day","2","2022-09","2022-09-26","Visited the property again after around 3 years. It seems the management is only concentrating on money profit & no guest satisfaction.

The staff is still very good, helpful & courteous specially in dining area & pool area.

But things are not so good inside the hotel, in room food menu the minimum costing dish is bread butter jam & that is 350 rs., Now that is too much for simple jam bread. Though i have seen rates even more but if you are taking rates of 5 star then why are your things are so poor, like jacuzzi not working, bath tub was having stains, breakfast buffet spread was very small.

Wifi charges are 500 rs for 24 hours. Not sure whether they invented 6G or something, due to which they are charging so much... 

Inside in the club if you want to play air hockey you need to pay 150 rs. for 15 minutes, the pool/billiards is chargeable even for the guest who have already paid for the stay. In Spa for ladies guest no massage facility available.

Also on reception, even late check-out was denied & was told we are sold out. Come-on man on Monday morning who gets sold out. In buffet breakfast there was not a single guest, then how can you get sold out, seems you have received the maximum profit & minimum guest satisfaction from your higher ups.

Will never visit this resort again....","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r861966799-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"34","120","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fahim_Khan_13","Fahim_Khan_13","659BF45FC51668D55AD27A136BFA8C26",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","Fahim_Khan_13",,"General Manager","863766286","en","2022-10-09","Oriental Bowl","Dear Ms.Khan,

"Strictly okay due to renovations","3","2022-08","2022-08-29","Pros: 
1. The club was okay - they have toddlers playing area, some dance area, DJ playing Bollywood songs and some indoor games (TT, fooseball, carrom)
2. Beds are huge and really comfortable 
3. Cleanliness was good
4. Food was also okay. 
5. Nice quick weekend gate away from Busy city streets. 

Cons:
1. Due to on going renovations pool and spa is shut.. which was a big bummer.
2. Room locks are problematic. They had to call a service guy to fix our lock. But eventually had to shift our room. Same happened with some other guests as well. 
3. The beach attached is not at all clean. Laden with grease & plastic.
4. View from rooms isn’t all that great. Definitely not worth spending 5-6k for pool view room. 
5. Food is ridiculously expensive. 2 filter coffees costed us 540 rs and the milk was of bad quality. Although food tastes good - it isn’t worth the cost. 

Pro tip - Don’t fall for room categories such as delux room/ executive room/ etc - they are all identical. Just costlier ones are on higher floor but it doesn’t make sense since the view isn’t that great anyway.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r857193736-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452390706","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1200","1","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RollerCoaster09","Shrutika MS","98C8FA8DBEA60404082BEA4747930117",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","RollerCoaster09",,"General Manager","863771933","en","2022-10-09","Oriental Bowl","Dear Guest,

"Not worth the money","3","2018-08","2018-08-03","Stayed here for a company stay, for a week. My impressions of the place:
1. Room - I was given a single room which, for the money being charged, was quite pathetic (Rs. 4500 + taxes). I actually measured the size of the room, it was barely 15 ft x 8 ft, excluding washroom. The room is small hence the air coming from the AC vents hits you directly on your head and i woke on both mornings with a bad headache. Decided to keep the AC switched off. The washroom is also so small that if unless you close the door, you can't access the washbasin. The furniture in the rooms is old fashioned, not to my taste. There is a thin slab given in place of a working table, wasn't very convenient. The only upside was that upon my request, they upgraded me to the ""Club Room"" which was a major major improvement. Nicely done room, with proper table for keeping your laptop. The washroom in this one was much better, with a bath tub. If this was the room given at the first instance, it would have been a different experience.
2. Location: Right next to Dadar East Station, quite in the centre of city. Full marks for that.
3. Food: I only had breakfast here and while the spread was manageable (should have been wider though), I wasn't very impressed with the quality of food (eggs were super hard boiled, wheat flakes were moist, cold milk wasn't cold enough) and the flavours were ordinary. Never had dinner given the exorbitant prices, almost comparable to a 4/5 star property and I was never impressed with food in mornings, so did not have the confidence.
4. Amenities: They have a fitness centre which is nothing more than few machines kept in corridors. You can't even stretch your hand there, and its stuffy in there. But at least they had a fitness centre. They also have a swimming pool, which i never checked out. So cannot comment. They do not seem to have satellite TV (in today's age!) and the cable does not have very user friendly menu. Half the channels don't even come. 
5. Service: The staff was courteous and always more than willing to help. Always cheerful and greeted me everytime they saw me. They have been trained very well, I must say.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d301496-r602553840-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"2304","68292942","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/12/11/4e/indianpopcorn.jpg","3456","89","138","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indianpopcorn","Pranav S","2B0216E6092B0748E1EEC53785011B46",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Indianpopcorn",,,,,,,,"Opp. Swami Narayan Temple Dadar (E), Mumbai, Mumbai 400014 India","Mumbai","India","400014","Maharashtra","Opp. Swami Narayan Temple","Dadar (E), Mumbai","301496","19.017252","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.84463","Ramee Guestline Dadar Hotel","310","3.9","18","12","67","109","105","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d301496-Reviews-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.rameehotelsindia.com/guestline-dadar-mumbaihotel.aspx"

"Value for money ","3","2018-06","2018-06-26","Stayed at the hotel during my 2 days visit to Mumbai. The hotel is pretty strategically located within walking distance of Dadar railway station. The place also has an easy access to cabs. While the rooms and furniture is not modern, they are surely spacious compared to Mumbai standards. The service was pretty prompt and courteous. Not much to expect from the buffet as the spread seemed to be pretty moderate. A lot of local taxis operate from just outside the hotel building and this created a lot of noise from the very early morning. We were alloted room in the 1st floor and thanks to this noise, we could not get a sound sleep.

"Sound proof....Covenient...and Cosy..!!!!!","4","2018-05","2018-06-06","Hello to all readers and to all Staff @ Trip.
I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights starting 24th May 2018, during my brief journey to India. This is my review. 
This is the only hotel where I booked a room directly on the hotel website. The cost was slightly cheaper than what various travel engines advertised. I received an instant confirmation with a reservation number ( credit / debit card required to secure this) with a notice to pay all monies at checkout. The hotel offered a complimentary airport pick up from both airports and I emailed them a wrong arrival time. This was picked up by Dadar Sales team @ Ramee and they got back to me ASAP. Very thoughtful of them. I informed them of my correct arrival time and all was sorted. Only one way transfer is complimentary. I was picked up by a polite hotel cab driver and the journey took 30 mins to reach hotel from domestic airport , during peak traffic. The check in was smooth and I was offered an upgrade to master bedroom ....Room 104. Thanks to reception staff for that. The first thing I noticed inside the hotel was quietness and calm. This hotel is next to a very busy road leading to Dadar rail station( next to hotel) . This is a very busy noisy chaotic area with a high level of noise pollution. Inside the hotel......inside the room......everything was calm. Excellent. My guest room was large and sufficient for me. The bed was good, soft and clean linen. AC worked fantastic......Polar temperature  throughout... Mumbai was hot and humid ( 37 to 38 deg celsius + around 55% humidity)......serious discomfort and dehydration if you are out and about. The room had all 5 star amenities. Kettle , locker , cabinet, mini bar and nice medium sized bathroom. The only non-5 star item was a standard def TV. The bathroom was well stocked and the towels were soft / good/clean. Medium sized mirror and a working hair dryer. This hotel is in a suburb in the middle of the city. And it was very convenient for me to travel anywhere I wanted. I used app based taxi services to go from A to B. During my stay ...there were no corporate parties / weddings / functions etc.......so it was very quiet in the night. Perfect for a good sleep. I ate out at few places which I will review later. The complimentary buffet breakfast was standard and just adequate. Not a lot of spread but how much can a person eat at 9 am in the morning ? The hotel staff , reception staff and room service staff, security staff, restaurant staff....everyone .......all were polite ,courteous and professional. I had ordered room service dinner on one of the nights and it was very good. Well prepared spicy goat meat curry with rotis, lentils and salad. Delicious and good. The hotel has a small gym on the top floor and a medium sized pool. I did not use them but the pool was clean and maintained . There was a gym staff member who showed me around. Thanks fella ! The hotel has an in-house restaurant and bar, that is open till late. This hotel is located in such a place.....that whatever you need......provisions, medicines , snacks , ATM , Clinic, transport etc ....everything is 5 mins walk. Over all , I had a fabulous stay. I used to stay at Ramee Juhu, but during previous 2 times ....I could not sleep because of club music banging through the walls. So I chose to stay in Ramee Dadar and I am happy that I made this decision. I am returning to hotel for another stay in December 2018. A big thanks to everyone @ Ramee Dadar. Thumbs Up...!!!!!!

"Good hospitality, comfortable and convenient","5","2017-12","2018-01-17","Hotel is about 15 minutes walk to Dadar Train station and there is also a huge market and shops. We stayed for four nights and then another five nights after travelling to other parts of India. Rooms are fairly clean, comfortable and spacious. Beds are comfortable. There was always hot water for shower though the bath was a bit difficult to get in and out of. Breakfast is great with a good variety of food. We had dinner in the restaurant most nights and food is very tasty. Staff are very helpful, polite and made our stay a very enjoyable one. The hotel can provide a cab for about £25 a day for 8 hours for sightseeing.

The Manager just surprised me with a complimentary Airport drop after a long days shopping in Mumbai when we returned back to the Hotel. I was trying to book a Cab in the lobby and the Manager walked upto me and offered a complimentary ride to the Airport!

After fasting for the whole day, i have visited this place for business. I reached only at night 12:30. The hotel staf tells me they can give me only 2 bottles of mineral water of half a litre. Beyond which I will be charged. I am shocked at this inhuman behaviour. 2 people staying in a room and all you get is only a 500ml bottle for the day. Moreover, they charge you 125 rupees per bottle for the additional ones. The least i could expect is some courtesy from the hotel staff considering its summer time and also the fact I have been fasting and traveling the whole day to reach this horrible place.

Room ambience was good and also enjoyed a view which is a treat to our eyes …. Beautiful beach with hawks flying around…….

Overall gives you a feel of a stay in a village, away from the city hassles ……. We would any day go ahead and rate The Retreat 5 on 5……..

"Beachfront, however, not worth it ","3","2021-12","2021-12-06","The place is situated right next to the beach , the reason why we decided to book our stay here. However, since the locality is inhabited by fishermen, you can smell fish, prawns etc in the hotel too, which kind of makes the experience little sour. Also, you can't visit beach because of the smell and the fishermen put all their daily catch just behind the hotel , so you have to literally cross the entire lot to reach beach. 

Rooms are decent and budget friendly. Staff is polite and nice too. Though guests do not follows any kind of Covid related protocol inside the hotel . And hotel staff also doesn't bother much about it. 

Breakfast option is very limited and you might want to carry some snacks with you for untimely hunger !

Thank you for selecting The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre, Mumbai as your accommodation choice in Mumbai.

We note your feedback about the fish smell and would like to state that whilst our hotel is on the beach front, the area in front of the hotel (on the beach) is not a part of our hotel. Kindly note that the referred smell is dependent on the wind direction, the season, ocean tide and other factors which are beyond our reach.  Nonetheless, we take some measures in the hotel to limit this smell. Please be advised that guests are constantly reminded to wear masks and follow other safety protocol, apart from sign ages that are placed in public areas.  Your positive feedback about the staff and the quality of rooms has been shared with the concerned teams.

We thank you for your feedback, as that helps us to refine our services further and we look forward to welcoming you again soon at The Retreat, the preferred leisure destination in Mumbai!

 AC not working in the recreation centre. We were sweating like pigs.

Also please don’t go for the breakfast option. The breakfast is pathetic and the food is really bad! 

Also they charge you for Ice and also for cutlery! 
Which is not mentioned anywhere. Then they also have sanitisation charges which I don’t know why, but in these Covid times don’t you have all that included in the room rate cause isn’t that supposed to be why I came to to hotel in the first place cause it’s safe and sanitised? 

Guys 15% of the room rate is charged for all miscellaneous stuff which cannot be avoid. So suggest you look at another option like The Retreat , Novotel, JW Marriot ... that don’t comprise on service and also not on their reputation.

"A very Good Place which can be Excellent","4","2020-01","2020-01-05","I was looking for a single day option to stay in Mumbai with my wife and daughter and came across The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre. The pictures looked good, and the place is as equally good. 

Pros
- Rooms are good, clean
- Pool is superb
- Beautiful Place, access to the beach which is pretty clean
- Staff is good, smiling, special mention of Mr Rakesh, he greets you every time he meets you.

Cons (not really cons but these are points which can be definitely improvised upon)
- Breakfast (limited options, especially for non vegetarian)
- Pool Water Temperature (it's cold throughout the year, when I visited it was cold weather, and with the cool water, I could spend very less time in the pool)

Overall it is a great place for a weekend gate away.

Tips
- Choose the pool facing rooms, and preferred on the 3rd floor or above.
- Opt for breakfast and meal (at least Lunch or Dinner). Since the resort is far from the market, it will be a good to opt for meal.
- Book in advance, you may end up with a good deal.

"Average ","3","2019-12","2019-12-23","Whilst visiting Mumbai we choose “The Retreat “as a place for us friends to hang out and spend a night . This was our first visit and so were NOT aware of the overpowering fish smell which is all around the hotel and outdoor pool area. Avoid this place if you are vegetarian as the smell is unbearable .
The staff were polite , however service was extremely slow in all areas from getting drinks to the pool area to the final bill .
Breakfast buffet was ok , cold on occasions . 
There is charge of 500 Rupees for 24 hours WiFi , WiFi did not work at all in our room after ringing multiple times and requesting reception to rectify there service the response was quite laid back . 
There is charge for almost everything so be prepared if you request something . We paid 50Rupees each for room slippers something most five star hotels provide for free anyways , one green tea costed at 140 Rupees . 
If you need room service for food you need to deposit 2000 Rupees at reception first.  
We were told at the reception that retreat had private gate to enter the beach area . To our horror when the security guard opened the gate... the place was filled with dead fish and crabs drying out in open air . There is no stairs or proper way to enter beach . 
We paid over 15000 rupees for one night for slow service and additional charges for almost everything else on top of it .

"Great hotel, good care with sick child","5","2015-12","2016-01-02","I chose this hotel based on reviews I read here and on another hotel booking site. I was impressed with the positive feedback, particularly in regards to cleanliness and quality of staff.  We have two young children and needed a good place in the heart of Mumbai we could be comfortable in for a few days. This hotel was a perfect place. Nice rooms, kept up nicely, very delicious food. Three days into our stay, our oldest daughter became very very sick. It was a scary experience,  but Hotel West End is right next to Mumbai Hospital!  I did not know this when I booked here, but how wonderful to get good care in an urgent situation. So that is a plus.  Also, the staff here was very gracious and honored our every request for help, clean linens, fresh beverages and answering questions so we could get the help we needed for our child.   We had to extend our stay, and they allowed us extra night with no questions asked.  We had the ""family room"" and it was so comfortable with a sitting area and nice bed and couch. Many of our family members in Mumbai came to see us here while our child was sick and the hotel never had a problem with visitors to our room. 

I would recommend this place to anyone anyone who wants a lovely place to stay in Mumbai. It is a great hotel.

"A nice old-fashioned hotel","4","2015-09","2015-10-01","Three of us stayed here for 2 nights on a recent, first, family visit to Mumbai.  We deliberately chose this hotel because of its location.  The taxi driver from the airport had difficulty finding the street and hotel so if you are planning a visit, make sure that you have a good location map.  The hotel itself sits on a rather dirty and busy street, typical of our expectations of this city.  It is only a short taxi ride from the Gateway of India or Marine Drive and a couple of friendly taxi drivers wait outside ready, it would seem, to take you anywhere. Inside the hotel is very clean, dated with a welcoming and helpful staff. The lifts struggle with more than a couple of people. The rooms are large and bright with firm beds and dated air conditioners that try hard to keep the temperature at a reasonable level.  The food in the restaurant is very good with a wide choice and very attentive service. We'd definitely stay there again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r315501960-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","3","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimE3665","JimE3665","BE753D6A8A8584A344E78A0DDF684784",,"186335","Lincolnshire, United Kingdom","Lincolnshire","JimE3665",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"

 We regret to hear about your less than satisfactory experience at our hotel. Certainly, this is not the standard of service we aim to provide. We sympathize with the inconvenience you faced due to the prolonged check-in process and the bed request not being met.

We're also looking into the airport drop service that you mentioned. Though certain conditions may apply, we continue to strive to meet our guests' needs and requests. We understand that the behavior of Kamlesh was unpleasant and we assure you that necessary action will be take to rectify this. We strive to ensure every guest feels valued and respected, and we're disappointed that we failed to achieve this during your stay. We understand your expectations given the charges you paid for the night, and we regret falling short in meeting them. We hope that you will give us another opportunity in the future to offer you the high standard of hospitality we're known for. For your future visits, we would like to offer upgrade subject to availability. Your feedback regarding food and other amenities will be appreciated.

"Life-Threatening Experience at Era by Orchid, Mumbai Terminal 2 – Room Ceiling Collapsed!","1","2025-06","2025-06-20","Life-Threatening Experience at Era by Orchid, Mumbai Terminal 2 – Room Ceiling Collapsed!

I had a deeply distressing and life-threatening experience during my recent stay at Era by Orchid, Mumbai Terminal 2.

I checked into the hotel around 8:30 AM and was given early check-in by 10:00 AM. After freshening up, I left for some personal work and returned to my room (Room No. 218) at approximately 6:45 PM. While having dinner in the room, I noticed a strange, unpleasant smell. I assumed it was due to the ongoing rain and didn’t think much of it.

Moments later, to my absolute shock, a stone suddenly fell inside the room. I stood up in confusion, trying to understand where it came from — and within seconds, the entire ceiling of the room collapsed right in front of me. It was terrifying. My phone and luggage were buried under the debris. I was in a complete state of panic and barely managed to escape being injured — or worse.

I immediately called the hotel reception and informed them of the emergency. Shockingly, it took nearly 10 minutes for a single cleaning staff member to arrive, and only after more time passed did the rest of the hotel team show up. Rather than treating the situation with urgency, the hotel staff tried to downplay the incident. They offered to upgrade my room and began persuading me to accept a voucher for a future stay as a form of apology.

The hotel managers kept trying to convince me not to escalate the matter or leave a review, promising that they would “compensate” me. But this was not a minor inconvenience — this was a serious safety hazard that could have cost me my life. I was unable to sleep all night due to the trauma. I checked out early the next morning around 6:45 AM to catch my flight, still in shock from the previous night’s events.

I’m writing this not out of anger, but out of responsibility — so that no one else has to face such a terrifying and unsafe experience. A hotel has a basic duty to ensure the structural safety of its rooms. This was a failure of the highest order.

Please think twice before booking this property.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d307086-r1013907304-IRA_By_Orchid_Mumbai_T2_International_Airport-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452389307","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/120meghan","megha N","532ABAF7DE0ED1B14795A16F3053F4ED",,,,,"120meghan",,"General Manager","1014967534","en","2025-06-24","IRA By Orchid  Mumbai ","Dear Ms. Megha,
Namaskar!

First and foremost, please accept our heartfelt apologies for the unfortunate incident that occurred during your recent stay at Ira by Orchid, Mumbai. We fully understand the discomfort and distress this must have caused you, and we deeply regret that your experience did not reflect the standards of safety, service, and comfort we strive to maintain.

We would like to humbly clarify that such an occurrence is extremely rare and unprecedented in our hotel’s history. It was as unexpected and concerning for us as it was for you. Please be assured that we conduct regular inspections and follow strict preventive maintenance protocols throughout the property. On the day of the incident, the hotel was nearly at full occupancy, and no such concerns were reported from any other room or section underscoring that this was an isolated, unforeseen event.

Due to monsoon-related dampness, a small portion of the ceiling gave way unexpectedly. Our team responded immediately by shifting you to a suite room, as ensuring the comfort, safety, and well-being of our guests is not just our priority,it is our responsibility.

With reference to your mention of our team trying to persuade you, we would like to clarify with due respect that there was no intention to force or influence your decision regarding sharing a review. We sincerely respect your right to express your experience, and any communication from our side was merely to share our concern and reaffirm that this situation does not reflect our usual standards.

The compensation offered was a sincere gesture of goodwill and not as a substitute for your experience,but as a token of our genuine regret for the inconvenience you encountered.

Once again, we extend our deepest apologies and appreciate you for bringing this matter to our attention. Your feedback plays a vital role in helping us maintain and continuously enhance the standards of service and care we strive to offer all our guests.

Your feedback is most rewarding as it is our endeavor to ensure that our guests have memorable experiences each time they stay with us. 

The fish smell is out of the hotel's control as the local fishermen use the beach adjacent to the hotel to dry their fish. At the hotel, we are doing our best to reduce the impact of smell by having agarbatis outside the hotel and deodorizes inside.

We look forward to welcoming you again soon and hope that the Retreat Hotel Mumbai remains your preferred hotel on all your future visits to Mumbai.

"Great resort, but a little over-rated","4","2019-11","2019-11-21","We were at The Retreat last tow days for our anniversary celebration. We loved staying here. However, here are some great and not-so-great points :

GREAT :

Service : The staff here is very attentive and courteos
Cleanliness : Rooms and premises are very clean and very nicely maintained.
Huge pool : The pool is huge, we stayed in the pool-view room and it was superb

NOT so great :

1. We paid about 17000 for 2 nights with breakfast. However, the hotel charging such tariff [claiming a 5-star rating] charges 500 rupees per day for Wi-Fi

2. The restaurant menu is limited. Also, when we ordered for Pizza, they said that Pizza was not available. This is not expected of a 5-star rating hotel.

3. They have 2 restaurants - Tangerine and Oriental bowl. Liquor is served only in Oriental Bowl restaurant that serves Chinese. So, if you want to have liquor with your food, you HAVE TO EAT chinese and CANT EAT any other cuisine.

Otherwise, this hotel is great to stay for Mumbaikars too","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r728107251-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"50","116418413","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/f0/67/6d/richa-r.jpg","50","31","157","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichaRaj","RichaRaj","D31BB30B6745D3D94CDBD71700DE5B7F",,"1532344","Navi Mumbai, India","Navi Mumbai","RichaRaj",,"Manager","733849388","en","2019-12-20","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Best Hotel In Mumbai for Peace Lover!!!","5","2019-09","2019-11-10","I have spent 2 days in this hotel and I love everything about this hotel to be precise their location, near by beach, having swimming pool of course with certain timings, Food was awesome, Service was commendable, rooms were spacious, having tea and coffee in room, good bathroom.

Only thing I dont like about this hotel that you need to add wifi while booking as this is so stupid as every hotel offers wifi and they dont have to pay extra but these people ask you to pay 500 Rs/- for wifi and this is not acceptable especially when prices of this hotel is not budget friendly. So make sure to check while booking about the wifi access because I haven't paid attention while booking.

I would suggest you to visit once if you want peace in Mumbai which is next to impossible in crowded city like Mumbai.Little bit far from city but it's all worth it trust me it took me 1 hour during afternoon to reach this hotel from Vile Parle West.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r725373326-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"720","389842259","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/3c/85/53/nahidk85.jpg","720","11","117","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NahidK85","Nahid K","1587F5E82338A49297FD516674A47B5D",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","NahidK85",,"Manager","728513309","en","2019-11-23","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest

"Inconsistent - poor on communication","3","2019-11","2019-11-09","Overall stay was good. But its full of inconstancies
- Checkin was smooth, rooms are decent size, cooling is good, offers perfect sea view. While there are strong smells in the corridor. Toiletries are basic. Room service requires follow ups
- The swimming pool is big, and well attended. But in sorry state. Broken tiles, algea in places, bird feathers floating. The floating restaurant is not appealing at all.
-  Club house is good, steam bath and jacuzzi is clean and functional too. Attendant Nitin was helpful
- Dinner spread is limited with no starters on the weekdays and only 2 starters on the weekends. Desserts are good. 

Based on previous reviews, at the time of check-in we asked about the movie screening and activities for children. They said it was only for Diwali. On the very next day they arranged the programs and there was no communication. My daughter was disheartened  because she could not attend anything. We were disappointed. Mr Kashinath, the manager was only saying yes mam and wasn't apologetic at all. We raised concerns about the buffet spread as well. Mr Felix and Mr Vincent managers at the restaunt made it up to us by their excellent service. Also offered a nice fried fish. 

Not sure if we will visit again. But those who are planning to visit, do not expect 5 star hospitality. Facilities and property location can be enjoyed thoroughly. Choose breakfast plan only. There is a restaurant nearby (rated 3.7 stars on zomato) which delivers food at the hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r725226711-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"3048","560225883","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/64/5e/5b/mrsd601.jpg","3048","23","73","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsd601","Mrs D","28899D4E34673A895D3BADD60E3845E2",,,,,"mrsd601",,"Manager","733849360","en","2019-12-20","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Spare yourself and your money, don't go to this hotel","2","2019-09","2019-09-20","Pros:
1. Breakfast
2. Swimming pool
3. Beach entry (the beach is filled with plastic though)
4. Some of the stuff are courteous

Cons:
1. Rude receptionists who are asking for money while checking in even when the pre-booking has been done
2. Very poor quality of food which is served from their restaurant (and the price is toooo high.)
3. Even after complaining about the food quality, they made same mistakes again and again. I guess they dont have many good chefs.
4. Dirty bed sheet and pillow covers. White pillow covers have become brownish yellow in colour
5. This is the first hotel who says ""wifi is not a part of your package"". One of its kind.
6. Every complaint gets followed by an empty promise that ""someone senior will talk to you"". This promise mostly remains unfulfilled.
7. Finally, they claim that they are 5 star hotel. Google says that it's a 3 star one. Frankly, I have stayed in far far far better 3 star hotels. In fact, star system cannnot be applied to this hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r711357436-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452361217","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/248ritams","248ritams","01EBD316FF05F9BEC9D4CD4E0DD08B72",,,,,"248ritams",,"Manager","712794637","en","2019-09-25","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear

The floor lobby on 5th floor was having unpleasant smell. The wall paper had pilled off from the wall in the lobby at few places and other places it was stained black.The overall atmosphere was depressing.

"Bad Stay","1","2019-07","2019-07-08","First of all I won't recommend anyone to visit this Hotel if you are not from Mumbai reasons mentioned below.
1. Front Office Staffs were very Rude specially Ms. Sonia & Mr. Prashant ( I guess this was the name) they were talking like I owe them Money ""Nai ho sakta Bola na"" ""Tum Room Check Karo and all what I believe is  Front office is the first impression of any Hotel and when your staffs behaved like this no one wants to come.
2. They charge more than Mrp which is illegal as per Consumer Forum Jago Grahak Jago they charged 130 for sprite Can and Mrp was 30 if they want to charge 130 they can tie up with Aerated Drink company and ask them to supply with Higher Mrp than it's ok to Charge same with Beer Pictures attached and I am moving forward to file complaint.
Good is:
Food & Beverage department start from Coffee shop Manager till stewards everyone were very helpful and u can enjoy good food at room service though the price is bit on higher side but worth bcoz of awesome portions size and good taste.

When we arrived at the hotel, I was surprised to see the hotel condition, it's not at all a 5-star property, room walls were stained and full of dumping, Hotel provides water bottle filled of water from restaurant rather than mineral water as expected. When I had ask for the mineral water, hotel staff provided the same. The Moment you enter the Resort the whole area is full of Dry fish smell, it was horrible, NOWHERE this has been mentioned when I was booking due to which we had to spend full one day inside the room & then decided to leave next day though my booking was for two Nights. In the time of check out the person in counter kept me waiting for almost 20 mins ( Though there was no que and I was the only for check out ) , though the whole package has been paid through MMT & I didn’t asked for the invoice / receipt still I was kept on waiting , Just to deposit the keys and then I left those keys there & leave the resort. Overall it was very BAD EXPERIENCE , I will neither I will go ever  nor recommend anyone to go there.

The fish smell is out of the hotel's control as the local fishermen use the beach adjacent to the hotel to dry their fish. At the hotel, we are doing our best to reduce the impact of smell by having agarbatis outside the hotel and deodorizes inside.

"The No-Treat Hotel.","1","2019-04","2019-04-19","I stayed here for a single night, to start with the rooms, the rooms are too small, dirty, smelly, the walls were stained and they provide water bottle filled with water from their restaurants rather than mineral water(Bisleri, Aquafina) i had to ask them to provide the mineral water bottles and plus the hotel is undergoing renovation hence the repair guys keep coming to your window like ghosts every now and then. The service was worst above all, i had ordered for dinner and was being informed that i would have to settle the bill before consumption, which 5* hotel does this, i told them i would settle the bills at the time of checkout but still they were forcing me to pay the bill before consumption,  does not at all feel like a 5* hotel should not be anything above a 2* hotel. The only good thing about this hotel was the food it tasted really good, i had lunch and breakfast at tangerine, it was really yummy. The hospitality of the restaurant staff was much better than the hotel management. So please think thrice before booking this place.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r667763070-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","22","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohitm250","mohit m","90DAA42722BFBD8440E284A87A22971B",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","mohitm250",,"Manager","671499189","en","2019-05-04","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Rotten fish smell to greet you","3","2019-02","2019-02-26","The hotel actually is very pretty. Nice pool and scenary. But you are met with foul fish smell all over. We recommend travelling in monsoon, as the fish smell is not there, the local fisherman don't operate in monsoon.
The rooms very spacious and comfortable. Service was excellent.
The food at their Oriental Bowl was outstanding. The buffet spread at the Lagoon was also delicious with abundant choices. 
Sadly, the massage facility wasnt functioning. The pool was dirty with bird droppings. They do fumigate, but the birds come back after some time! 
Overall a good hotel, but more like a 3 or 4 star rather than a 5 star due to lack of key facilities.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r655141603-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452386394","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","1200","52","22","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewsforyou700","reviewsforyou700","9CC5723F77109598C9A6B2F52FAF49EE",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","reviewsforyou700",,"Manager","655926574","en","2019-03-02","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear reviewsforyou700,

Thank you for selecting The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre, Mumbai as your accommodation choice and for taking the time to share your compliments with us.

Your feedback is most rewarding as it is our endeavor to ensure that our guests have memorable experiences each time they stay with us. 

The fish smell is out of the hotel's control as the local fishermen use the beach adjacent to the hotel to dry their fish. At the hotel, we are doing our best to reduce the impact of smell by having agarbatis outside the hotel and deodorizes inside.

We look forward to welcoming you again soon and hope that the Retreat Hotel Mumbai remains your preferred hotel on all your future visits to Mumbai.

"Comfortable stay but militarised hotel","3","2019-02","2019-02-13","i stayed in the month of feb. The morning & evenings felt slight cold n daytime was hot. rooms are cozy and comfortable. Interiors are usual . Smoking isn't allowed in rooms . as such there are no smoking rooms in hotel . Bathroom has bathing tub and poor amenities. Only Soap, shampoo, Body moisturiser. basic amenities like Conditioner, toothpaste , Bathing gel not available. Pool view rooms and sea view rooms are on same side . from lower floors you might not be able to view sea . my room on 5th floor was a sea view. Other side namely palm view has Lush green Palm view with city in background. food spread at buffet breakfast was nominal. food was at times not cooked properly all the fried dishes were too oily . taste was compromised in all dishes. dinner was okay north indian food taste was bad . on the contrary cream of mushroom soup n continental sizzlers  were superb at taste and are must try . I wasn't very happy with reception as almost every query was left unanswered to call back. my first query asked for a match box they denied and said no smoking allowed than they said if you have your matchbox you can smoke but we wont provide. 
next query can I bring my drink down on poolside and smoke again no you are not allowed to take your own drinks. Leisure travellers avoid as check out time is 10 am which is too early. after making many hard request I was given an extension of 2 hours when there hotel was 80 percent vacant.
I wanted to go over seaside but the gate wont open after 630 at times it seemd I m living in a military hotel. I am responsible for my own good why hotel should be concerned or decide when can I go n not . and hotel should provide facility for guests to come n go anytime they like after all we came here for chilling not for doing drill as per hotel rules. if you were supposed to read rules of getting into swimming pool you will feel another military statement ; overall not a guest friendly feel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r652076258-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"50","121678812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/40/ab/dc/saurkhan.jpg","50","39","55","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saurkhan","Saurabh A.Khandelwal","6FF90C6F0C767173FAFDF060BBA85C66",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","saurkhan",,"Manager","655926447","en","2019-03-02","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear saurkhan

"I wouldn’t give it one - beware!","1","2019-01","2019-02-12","I was one of the guest invited to a destination wedding.  Appearance can be so deceiving. First of all, the website needs to be updated: get rid of 4/5 star hotel - it doesn’t measure up to it.  Beware, this place is isolated, first part of the Mumbai drive was ok, after all we were in India.   As we left for the outskirts, we were stuck in traffic for almost 40mins (one lane each way) and with no systematic driving, it was a mess.  First impression of the hotel was really nice until we got out of the car - boy that fishy smell hits you hard.  
We got greeted by a young man who held the door for us and went through security for bag check.  Great to know that the valued their guest safety.  Then we got greeted by another young person who was handing out some green and orange drinks which I decided not to try and headed for the front desk to get checked in.  There were 4 persons working and not one person gave us any eye contact or acknowledged.  One was checking in another guest, one was on the phone and other two were discussing something looking at the computer.  While I waited I looked at the lobby which was clean and modern updated furniture.  Still some hope. After waiting for 15 mins or so we got checked in.  I forgot about my frustration.  The checking in was smooth and quick, however, there was no mention to where the breakfast going to be, no mention of operating times, what was included and no mention about the internet.  We were informed to the elevators and that was it.   
In the elevator, there were photos (old prints) of Conrad hotel and couple of other brands that this management company manages and on the other side: had photos of the facilities (massage, Sauna &  game room) and activities had to offer (again old prints) proudly hang up.  There was some hope.  As we made our way to our room, you could literally see peeled paint, wauppet walls and flirty corridor carpets.  I couldn’t wait to see our room.  I was pleased with view; could just about see the ocean, pool and green grounds.  We were on the third floor.  To my surprise, the room and bathroom looked clean, so I thought.  I couldn’t be more wrong, the bathroom stung like smelly dirty rags, it was the shower curtain.  One thing I have to mention is that the housekeeping staff were great and prompt.  As soon as I made a call for housekeeping, they immediately came and fixed the issues.  Internet was a big issue; there were 3 persons in our room and internet service is only issued to 2 persons per room.  This was a big issue.  There was a charge for internet but because of the group block it was complimentary.  
I could go on and write down more issues but then I would be writing a book.   I will advice you on few more important issues; the property is so run down. The hallways sink of mildew/mold; there is so much of dampness in the air that the wall paint was peeling off, the carpet has probably never been vacuumed.  I saw a housekeeper sweeping the hallway carpet with sticks tied together to form a broom.  The bedsheets felt damp at night.   When I went to inquiry on the cost of massage and the location of the spa at the front desk, they had no clue but directed me to the spa.  When I got there, I was told that they had massage service available only for men and not women.  Very shocking.  The sauna was closed down and had not be in use for several months, the staff informed me.  
Question would be why not just move - couldn’t!   All the weddings events were mainly in the evening and it is very difficult to find transportation after 5pm.  Even if they agreed to take you, they would triple the rate.  One last note; what is up with a generic reply to guest’s review.   This management company has a lot to answer for and as for the owners of this place - this place could be a gem but it needs a lot of attention.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r651956697-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1024","299240698","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/d6/0c/fa/jparekh.jpg","1024","5","37","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jparekh","Jaymini P","CD3EF23F74EF732144C2DB6815D3C3B2",,,,,"jparekh",,"Manager","655926380","en","2019-03-02","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Jaymini P

"Five star? Sorry, not even close","3","2019-01","2019-01-10","Staying here for a week as part of a family wedding group reminded me of all the reasons I have pretty much abandoned big hotels in recent years and always look for a boutique experience or a private apartment.
The complex looks great from the outside (perhaps it was the relief on arriving in one piece after a marathon and hair-raising trip from central Mumbai) but on closer inspection it's easy to see the cracks - missing (cosmetic) tiles on the roof, damp-affected corridors (and rooms - the lower the floor you are on, and if you're not facing the pool side, the worse the problem seems to be and if you don't want to run air con non stop you will certainly notice it at this time of year) and very patchy service added up to a frustrating experience.
Staff are very willing but often clueless - they'll agree to do something and then forget, or get the wrong end of the stick, particularly at mealtimes, and are available in such numbers that their inability to run slick services is even more irritating.
Fittings are often wobbly, whether that's restaurant tables or electrical sockets, housekeeping and room service can proceed at a snail's pace, booking in and checking out takes an age with plenty of paperwork and stapling, and I needed reception (or twice the IT team) to reset the wi-fi at least once a day during my stay.
Food is pretty good, with lots of Indian options on the buffet which don't look that appealing but taste fine, and if you want to stay Western there's enough to keep you fed. The specialist Oriental restaurant which doubles as the bar is also work checking out.
The pool is a very appealing prospect with plenty of shade, but it also appeals to egrets and crows in great number and one member of staff with a clapperboard acts as a human scarecrow when they flock in at peak times. The grounds generally are peaceful and pleasant and there are a couple of secluded hammocks which are well worth seeking out.
The complex is right on the coast and you can walk out of the back gate (security permitting) for a stroll along the beach but while the sunset is striking you also have to put up with the stink of drying fish (a local industry) and plenty of rubbish.
The five star rating would not hold water in the UK, but to be fair the prices were very attractive to a Western purse. Won't be back, though.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r645078867-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1024","266445189","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/e1/a1/85/john-f.jpg","1024","749","525","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HitchinGannet","John F","F2410A8564F1F0A4838A56EF68356B53",,"658254","Hitchin, United Kingdom","Hitchin","HitchinGannet",,"Manager","655926174","en","2019-03-02","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear John F

The catering team was excellent & food was of good quality , maybe only the prawns served during the event was a bit stale & next morning had to rush to the toilet couple of times .

The pool & the vicinity around smells awful .the show for the 31st was well organized . Kudos to their team & Dj /mc.

Generally it was very clean, staff helpful and friendly but the hotel seems to be riding on its past reputation and no longer providing a service of that standard and price.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r281151979-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"378","207140443","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/58/b6/5b/leene281.jpg","378","10","20","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elena_in_wanderlust","elena_in_wanderlust","7450504CC646A0A844B854876DAED085",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","elena_in_wanderlust",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"

"STAFF NEEDS TO HAVE MORE ETTIQUITE","2","2017-10","2017-10-29","Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android

A prominent location indeed ,had chosen the hotel cause of prime location ,within reach to any far destination be in old or new mumbai.

The day we checked in - A very unpleasant welcome especially by staff Ms NEEDA,who i guess needs to learn to have more ettiquite while having conversation with their guest.

The first questioned asked by Ms Needa was when did we book our stay in the  hotel .
I could not comprehend her as the booking was shown as confirmed from 17th to 19th of Oct.(Print Out) .According to her CODE AND DECODE ""We cant accept you if the transaction is not done""- Talk to your agent !

Seriously it beats me! What transaction ,when i had already done the booking and Paid for the rooms as stated by Agoda a week plus before checking in.booking code  229712037.

According to Ms Needa i had to call my agent Agoda myself and speak to them ,clarify the glitches of Charges or payments then only then we will be allowed to check in only if they received the payment.

I did ask her what payments was she talking about .She was INDEED VERY RUDELY REPLYING From the begining since we had stepped in the hotel as if she owns the hotel and it seems we are some crap people checking in the hotel.It was indeed a humiliation as if we could not afford to stay in that hotel.

We had done all our hotels booking in Kolkatta,Shirdi the  same way as in Mumbai-Mumbai was the only exclusive one with such an issue and such a ""Great and Polite Staff"" like Ms Needa!

I had no choice but to call Agoda in Singapore to reconfrim my status of the hotel booking and there i was told that the hotel booking was confirmed and there were no other information that i should be aware of.

I was using my India prepaid sim to call Sin as my Sin Hp was locked hence inoperative.I did inform them (the staff) that my credit was low despite that  they took my hp in their office to talk to the customer representive from Agoda.

This really puzzled me- If there was a difference in the pricing then they should update in advance not on the day when a customer checks in .As we had paid as per mentioned by Agoda.

And to take my Hp in the office to talk was another blow.The best thing when i received my hp there was no balance left - Amazing Staff- Not even the courtsey to say that the balance was all used up while in conversation with Agoda in Sin.Simply the hp was  handed over to me and the staff told us to wait till they figured out the whole issue of payments.They kept blaming the Agent-Agoda. Isnt this the internal finance matter.

Nevertheless i  paitently waited along with,My wife and my niece.Meanwhile there was this gentlemen who came in with really polite mannerisim and the way he had handled the whole situation was indeed.He was Mr Frank the GM.

He had taken over the whole issue and had explained in such an professional way.While Mr Frank was in conversation with my wife ,Ms Needa had moved out towards the lobby - while doing so she had made faces on us to her staff who stood out and this was noticed by myself personally. 

We urge if you do have a CCTV Please have a look on us checking in and how Ms Needa had behaved during the whole duration! Timing approximately in between 1610hrs to  1725 hrs india time.

No doubt Mr Frank had handled the situation beautifully and sincereThanks to him but on the contray your own staff had ruined the reputation of the hotel .

Indeed a heartfelt dissapointment on this Mumbai trip. Mr Frank had apologised on her behalf and said she was briefed accordingly. Mr Frank had mentioned that she was sorry - 

You think so- Really she felt sorry for us ? Mr Frank was doing his job on the supervisory level.If Ms Needa was indeed sorry wouldnt she approach us and sincerly apologise for her rude behaviour.

This is not a personal clash ,i am just amazed with such a reputated Hotel having such Staff with so little or perhaps no ettiquite and i think people should know the reality of  the staff - who is indeed  passionate about their scope of job.

I too have been working in Service industry since past 20 years.Doesnt matter how nasty your guest are they are still your paymaster and one should not forget that when working in the service line.

Infact Ms Needa was rude to her own staff Mr Bala who was together with her at the reception when we came in .Amazing how do you allow your staff to bully not only the Guest but also your own internal staff.

I would appreciate if The HOD could look into this matter personally.

I am indeed upset internally.If not for my wife i would have left the hotel immediately where there is no respect or hospitality shown . It only comes in As SERVICE RECOVERY . IS THAT THE WAY ? ..

No  doubt service recovery was done  but did it actually help .I do not think so as your staff had made my memories with an unpleasantries.

Its our holiday but ..what had happened will surely be remembered and be an example of a Good Service Commumication Skills with your guest.

I hope to hear from your respective department .If there is anh further queries please do contact me at vjbatman61@gmail.com or darshanas@yahoo.com

Awaiting your kind reply .

Thanking you.

Warm regards

"Brilliant","5","2017-08","2017-08-24","Staff : All staff from security, bell boys, waiting, housekeeping, pool attendant and receptionists were friendly, caring and always welcoming. Special mention of Ashish, Needa, Robin and Bala as we associated with them more frequently at the front desk. They even convinced me to cancel my airport hotel booking later in the trip and put up at the Ramee offering complimentary transport to the airport.
Location: So strategic on the doorstep of Dadar station, in fact on our return from upcountry the coolie brought our luggage staring to the hotel. Ramee has a good Punjabi restaurant as well as good eateries within walking distance.
Breakfast : Included in the price, was a perfect start to the day. Egg counter and new items each day of indian breakfast, fresh juices and pastries. 
Pool : Well maintained and clean, just what you need after a day out in Mumbai. The attendant even taught my son how to swim underwater. 
Definitely, our preferred hotel for Mumbai and highly recommend to friends and relatives in London.

"Excellent service, Great staff","5","2017-08","2017-08-20","I've just come back from this wonderful country with the kindest people on earth ... India.  What a trip! And besides the beautiful country, the magical city of Mumbai and its superb people, another element which made my stay there a memorable one was the hotel where I stayed at, for 26 days. An excellent location, a centrally located hotel next to Dadar east train station, an area with cafes and restaurants around it.  A very clean hotel with great service and a 5 star hotel staff. They made my stay there an unforgettable one. They were always worried if I was fine and if I needed anything else besides all the perfect services they provided. I'd like to thank all the staff for their work and collaboration but especially 4 people who treated me like family. Mr. D. Frank, the duty manager who was always smiling and was there for me whenever I needed his help. Mrs. Needa & Mr. Robin two of the receptionists who were so friendly,  kind and helpful as well as the rest of the staff of course.  And last but not least the maitr of the restaurant who was always worried if my meals were satisfying which they were since food quality and service were simply excellent.  To all of you, thank you for making my stay there a comfortable one and for being so hospitable. Keep up the good work!!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d301496-r515565272-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"564","360934481","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/83/6c/51/tompir13.jpg","564","8","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tompir13","Tompir13","653AAB14E4E1A9745A7784C02DE41C5B",,"189400","Athens, Greece","Athens","Tompir13",,"General Manager","523373226","en","2017-09-11","dadarsales","Dear Guest,

"Great staff","4","2017-02","2017-03-26","A nice hotel in a convenient location. Near the Dadar railway station. Easy to assess the city or north to Bandra. 
The staff are very friendly and always willing to help and a great asset to this hotel. 
Having access to a pool in Mumbai is good. Its on the roof top and opens in the morning and the afternoon. 
Hotel is clean and it has a good selection range for breakfast, Indian and western. 
Mumbai is one of the most expensive places to stay in india and Ramee is good valve for money. 
Cons- The wifi is terrible. Not always accessible in the rooms and always having to sign in is a constant pain. 
As seems usual in india the Ramee is missing a preventive maintenence program with sum repairs and upkeep lacking. 
The rooms don't have opening windows or exhaust and as such can become stuffy.
The restuarant food is expensive compared to outside outlets.

The fish smell is out of the hotel's control as the local fishermen use the beach adjacent to the hotel to dry their fish. At the hotel, we are doing our best to reduce the impact of smell by having agarbatis outside the hotel and deodorizes inside.

The rooms are spacious and if you get a poolside room on the higher floor you can get a majestic view of the Arabian sea. They have a huge pool for swimming.

We were allocated a pool facing room & the pool view was really beautiful. 
The room was good & spacious with bath tub, all their rooms have bathtub as informed during the booking time,
 
We started the day in the warm Jacuzzi next to the swimming pool, then we went to the swimming pool, the staff near the swimming pool was very helpful & very attentive.
We then went to the children's room in the club house, it is good with few swings, good for the kids. In clubhouse we played carom, table tennis & the board football games. We had the Lunch in the Tangerine Cafe, the manager in the restaurant was very nice. In evening we went for swimming & again to club house to play games & in night had buffet dinner in Tangerine Cafe, the dinner was good,

"Fishy Conclave","3","2018-10","2018-10-15","We had a reunion recently and therefore stayed there for 1 night/day. 

The first thing that hits a person as soon as you enter the property is the strong and overpowering stench of dried fish. Perhaps somewhere nearby the fishermen must be drying fish. The putrid smell of fish accompanies you everywhere to even the hotel floor corridors.

The property is old and this is quite evident. Peeling paint and wall paper adhesion deformity at several places. Step inside and one discovers large sized room which is a good point. But step inside the washroom and you find the mirrors that are stained and old.

Coming to food, we had a buffet spread for 2 days and frankly nothing there's nothing I can write about. The tikkas (chicken) that were being served while we had a cocktail dinner were just too spicy to digest.

The only plus this property has is the large sized pool though I can't comment as did not find the time to take a dive.

Simply put, quite a disappointing stay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r625062481-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"800","118996954","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/17/bf/da/almatysen.jpg","600","40","59","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/almatysen","BOMsen","551BC3BE6A8AB85EE67D22A1989AA165",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","almatysen",,"Manager","636961005","en","2018-12-01","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

Not very far from the city. A great place for a getaway. 

A little dampness in the corridors but the rooms were lovely and clean with amazing view of the massive pool and the beach.

Loved it. 

The food is superb. Anything you order is perfect.

"Strong Dry fish smell makes it average","3","2018-04","2018-09-20","Its a mixed bag I would say based on my 2 nights stay in April,2018 !

Check in/Checkout and Billing (+)
Pool side Rooms  (+)
Cleanliness (+)
Toiletries (-)
Breakfast (+)
Dinner (-) (for the price charged, spread isn't that great)
Swimming pool and Jacuzzi (+)
Games room, Gym and Garden/Lawn (+)

However all the pluses gets nullified with major minus point is strong dry fish smell (as fishermen dry their fishes on beach which is on back side of the hotel). 
Though beach is just 50-100 steps away, one need strong will to fight fishy smell to reach the sand and sea.
Rooms if sprayed with air fresheners every few hours, it can suppress strong fishy smell a bit.

Overall I find it over rated and over priced !","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r618232710-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"19","24","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1Oza","Dhrumal O","659B92A096D7AB77E0FE0AD092E25726",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","D1Oza",,"Manager","620905215","en","2018-09-30","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Nice hotel away from the chaos of mumbai","4","2018-09","2018-09-03","It's a nice hotel ,however I feel that the hotel should have been a 4 star rather than 5 .

If we talk about 5 star hotel , I would have an impression that everything would be spotlessly clean , which wasn't the case . The interiors of the hotel were pretty old . Door knobs polish were gone , the bathroom fittings were rusty and not shining . I felt that there was a need to overhaul the furnishings as mentioned above . 

Regarding the exterior the hotel was good , as mentioned in many reviews the swimming pool is a big attraction for all the guests visiting the place . The beach outiside is a big let down as it's in a pathetic shape . 

The staff were very welcoming and we're wishing always anyone would see you . The house keeping response was quite delayed if you asked something from them . To my surprise the WiFi is chargeable and even some of the toiletries like moisturizer, which is a shame . Haven't ever seen moisturizer been charged by any of the hotels ever . 

Food was ok , but I didn't feel it was of a 5 star standard . On the last day dinner we ordered a pizza and for 500 bucks the size of the pizza was small with just 4 slices .","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r613657101-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"150","19594651","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2a/fd/9b/avatar.jpg","150","46","200","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohit_b37","rohit_b37","7428822FED0DC7F3CE352BAEC3D29ABE",,,,,"rohit_b37",,"Manager","620904901","en","2018-09-30","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Beaches are calling..","3","2018-04","2018-06-28","The Retreat
As the name suggests this place caters for people who are coming up to relax a bit & also for corporate groups.

The place is very much inside & away from city hustle & also bears an old look. The lobby is pretty huge.. It's like walking from starting point to the end of the building to get to reception from the main porch..

Room given was good.. However, it shows evidently that the somewhat long due maintenance is pending.. They also had certain activities planned for their in-house guest .. The concierge person who will escort you will inform you about the same while in an elevator while the same was also depicted on the elevator wall.. A good use of the time I guess.. Stayed in Plam tree facing villa & though the view was not as great it gives you a peaceful feeling from inside..

"Decent weekend retreat","4","2018-05","2018-05-09","As we didn't want to travel too far and wanted to have a swim, good food & relaxation we chose The Retreat. 
The 
Front desk staff was courteous so was the other hotel staff. the food was good but the choices are limited in a-la-carte & waiting time is really long. as we booked from the hotel website we were offered a discount of 25% on food.

The pool is well maintained & is really great.The Jacuzzi too is well functioning & good fun. The gym is large but not really well equipped. More machines must be added. The steam room for gents was not working but the hotel did make alternative arrangements. the garden is  well maintained. 

The double bed was large and other amenities decent. Elevators are really fast and require hardly any waiting. Breakfast was typical of 5-star hotels without much novelty. Wi-Fi was free but worked mostly in the hotel lobby only.

Thank you for selecting The Retreat Hotel & Convention Centre, Mumbai as your accommodation choice and for taking the time to share your compliments with us.

Your feedback is most rewarding as it is our endeavor to ensure that our guests have memorable experiences each time they stay with us. 

The fish smell is out of the hotel's control as the local fishermen use the beach adjacent to the hotel to dry their fish. At the hotel, we are doing our best to reduce the impact of smell by having agarbatis outside the hotel and deodorizes inside.

We look forward to welcoming you again soon and hope that Retreat Hotel Mumbai remains your preferred hotel on all your future visits to Mumbai. 

With Regards,

"Well located , old world charm , great value for money .","5","2014-12","2014-12-30","I stayed in a double room for 4 nights . Room was big , well ventilated but as hotel is in a business district not much of views . The hotel has an old world charm. Staff is courteous & efficient .  Location is excelent , is a 10 minutes walk from Marine Drive & Church Gate Station . Plenty of Restaurants & Cinemas in the vicinity .  The restaurant serves good food and three buffets a day .  The only major drawback I found was that the TV had limited channels . Could not catch up with the India Australia matches . The management needs to understand that guests come from all over India & world , and when relaxing in the room after a tiring day , TV helps unwind watching your favourite programs . Hotels need to carry all channels today to suite the guests tastes .  Had a great stay  & recommend highly for the price .","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r246493358-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kavi53","Kavi53","DE9E0D3956CF4CCD9B18F97EF96E068B",,,,,"Kavi53",,"General Manager","248971491","en","2015-01-12","WestEndHotel1948","Dear Guest,

Certes vieillot, mais très propre et très bien situé, cet hôtel nous convient parfaitement.
Le personnel - et le propriétaire, régulièrement présent - sont très aimables et attentionnés.
Idéal pour des séjours en Inde assez longs et des aller-retours à Bombay, pendant lesquels on laisse des bagages et retrouve souvent la même chambre ."" welcome back home"" disent-ils.

"Falls short of expectations","3","2014-12","2014-12-20","I was on a business trip and had stayed in this hotel for 5 days.
The hotel has an old world charm, but it has not moved on to include the modern ammenities.

Pro's:
1. Very close to CST and Chruchgate, and right in the middle of the business district.
2. Comfortable and clean rooms
3. Dinner buffet is very good and fresh

Con's:
1. There were cockroaches in the bathroom. I tired to call the floor steward, but he was no where to be found.
2. Breakfast has sweets from previous night, e.g. Gulab jamuns from the night before are served next morning breakfast.
3. Lifts are not available on the way down. The lift door is kept open on the ground floor to service people going up, so not available if you want to come down. Out of the five days I got the lift only once to come down.
4. No free internet: it looks like a commercial decision, but for the frequent modern day business traveller is a must. The Internet rates are too high. In almost all good hotels around the world Internet is complimentary to the hotel room.
I might stay here again if I do not get any other option.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r245309087-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452387402","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bustravel2711","Bustravel2711","F64871DAB91BA6BD182FF6DE9707DF35",,,,,"Bustravel2711",,"General Manager","245600665","en","2014-12-23","WestEndHotel1948","Dear  Guest,

"Difficult to find, unknown to the neighbors........","3","2014-12","2014-12-19","Stayed at West End on Marine Lines overnight as a business traveller. Not only that the radio cab that I hired from the Mumbai Int'l Airport knew about the hotel, but none of the cabbies and autorickshaw wallahs standing on the Marine Lines could direct us where the Hotel is. Finally, 5th attempt succeeded and we could get to the hotel. The reception staff at 12.30 in the night certainly was not in a mood to welcome with a smile but other staff were as smiling as if it was receiving the first guest in a new hotel. There was no place whatsoever to find any food outlet open at that hour of the night in the neighborhood and predictably hotel had nothing to offer to its guests arriving late in the night.
The room was neat and clean, spacious and modestly decorated. The breakfast was average with limited choices, but food served during the meeting was a big disappointment. In my opinion,  with some efforts it can become a good heritage hote (established in 1948)l!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r245100281-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452388669","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","1200","69","131","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArunSharma","Arun S","67579B8E95244FAC12CAB50B5B109C87",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","ArunSharma",,"General Manager","245599542","en","2014-12-23","WestEndHotel1948","Dear Guest,

We thank you for taking out your time to fill this review.

We do have a reliable, safe & economical pickup/drop service from the Airport which you perhaps may like to try on your next visit to save the inconvenience caused to you during your last visit. We apologize  that the reception that you received was not as good as it should have been. From midnight to 07.00 a.m. we do have a limited service menu.

Some of our regular customers send us email about their meal requirement & it is served to them when they arrive between midnight to 07.00 a.m.

"Not worth","1","2014-10","2014-10-22","Good AC.

Friendly staff.

Congested  room & bathroom.

Hotel rates are around a 4 or 5 star, but services are pathetic, no complimentary  wifi or breakfast, no water bottles complimentary  except 1 for a day.

Lifts are horrible.

Dining food is bad, sweets in morning are leftovers of previous night. Even noon buffet  had some flying insects on deserts (mousse)

Mosquitoes  in room.

I took a smoking room and, smoke wasnt escaping out, very bad ventilation.

Balcony are for show off, very congested and not worth to be called as balcony.

Sorrounding  area is also very very congested and cheap crowd staring and stalking  as you leave the hotel premises.

IN SHORT, GET ANOTHER NICE PLACE IN SAME PRICE.
YOU WILL END  UP WITH AN ACTUAL  5 STAR FOR THE MONEY REQUIRED HERE.

Greetings from West End Hotel, Mumbai.
 Thank you for your valuable feedback and we apologize for the inconvenience caused to you; during your recent stay with us.
               In south Mumbai 4 star hotels charges about Rs. 5500/- & 5 star about Rs. 7500/- per day per room for an individual (17.42% Tax Extra). Whereas our room tariff is Rs. 4500/- + Taxes & other offers are as follows:-
1) Extra person in single room free.
2) Early Bird – book 21 days in advance & get 20% discount.
3) Stay 2 nights & get 03rd night @ 20% discount.
4) Long stay offer – A) 4-10 nights 10% discount 
                                  B) 11-15 nights 15% discount
                                  C) 16 nights & above 20% discount.
Some hotels do offer free Wi-Fi & some hotels charge for it. We have two rates one for room with breakfast & one for room only basis. You have opted for room only.

We never had any guests complain about mosquito or flying insects till now. Every floor has a butler to look after your needs & to give you highly personalized service.

Your room was 250 Sq. Feet (1 n half ton & air conditioned) so the ventilation should have sufficient. For additional ventilation the door leading to the small balcony could have been opened &  lot of fresh sea breezes could have entered the room
        We are surrounded by Bombay Hospital, central government offices, metro adlabs cinema, other offices sometimes the area does gets congested. Our lifts are old but well maintained. Our hotel is old but our customers say it has old world charm.

We wish that you will stay with us on next visit & we will make every effort to make your stay a happy one.

"Banquet Review","5","2014-10","2014-10-07","4th October, which was a big day for me. It was my engagement. It would be a bad part of me if i would not write a review for this Lovely hotel. First of all Thank you to Mr. Joy, Who is the Banquet Manager who performed his duties Simply Perfect.!! Thumbs up to him. This hotel is known to my family and we have attended family functions here. This time i would say it was my function and i wanted to be cautious about every little thing. I would say we had a crowd of 125 people for the engagement and we had been given the top terrace banquet for the function. It was well furnished with Tables and chairs covered with white cloth which looked beautiful. The arrangement of the stage was perfect as we wanted it with tables on each side. 

The bar was set up amazing with no soda's which were less for the function. The starters were amazing it matched perfectly with the booze we had. The food was delicious and good quantity which was enough for the crowd. The seating arrangement for food outside on the terrace was amazing. I would say they left no stone unturned to make the function successful. 

The staff is courteous and helpful in everything we needed. I would say this hotel is new but with modern thoughts and amenities. Its no less then the biggest hotels in B town.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r233178455-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"50","112305656","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/b1/a5/f8/farhad-d.jpg","50","116","238","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fardee14","Farhad Dastoor","12B7A5B6AD687D9D527B71645B20C621",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","fardee14",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"
"Affordable, Enjoyable and Lovable","4","2014-08","2014-08-20","The rooms are quite spacious and well maintained. The view may not be so great as it is centrally located but it is well connected to various parts of the busy city of Mumbai; theatres, hospitals, malls, railway station etc. and to the beautiful Queens necklace (the Marine Drive), thus, making it the perfect venue to stay and dine; and have a great quality time. The hotel and it's friendly staff have never failed to live up to our expectations. Our love for food and pampering our taste buds is only heightened by the lovely cuisine offered at their inhouse restaurant, which by me is the USP of the hotel. That's what makes this place so special to our heart.

The hotel is strategically located, so that it's easily accessible to city sights, restaurants, etc. The food is decent, but since you're in Bombay, would be more fun to eat out.

"Average room, friendly service","3","2014-05","2014-06-13","I was in Mumbai on a study abroad and had little knowledge of what to expect when we arrived.  The staff proved to be friendly enough providing many things we requested or needed.  The rooms are roomy, simple, and satisfarctorily clean:  The furniture dated but clean.  Internet is NOT free and is not easily used all over the hotel.  I had the best access when nearer to the front of the building rather than in my room in the back.  

There was a horrible smell in the hallway leading to my room--I didn't smell this all over, just in that part of the hall.  The air conditioning worked well in my room and the temperature was kept very comfortable.  The bathroom was sufficient in that it offered all necessary amenities, though the tub was very tall and a bit difficult to climb into.

The buffet offered is sufficient, even offering a few ""American"" breakfast choices (eggs, fruit, cereal--the milk is warm, FYI).  The service is quick and very pleasing.  Overall I was pleased with our stay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r210227559-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"450","25349105","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/82/cb/f1/sarianderik.jpg","254","9","37","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SariAndErik","SariAndErik","0F4EAB0E860D09A05DC1ADB080E9F7E9",,"60898","Atlanta, Georgia","Atlanta","SariAndErik",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"

And I remembered that my ring was at (west end)that very day itself and Rang the management asking for my rings, but the room service told that there were no rings as such.. Whichwas very shocking for me as I never expected this becuz I inquired it the very same day n I got a negative reply...

"Stay in Mumbai","4","2017-03","2017-03-10","Me and wife stayed at this property a few days ago for two nights.

Location- the property is located in the heart of Mumbai next to the Dadar Station on the eastern side. 
Although Dadar is known to be a crowded area, it is predominantly the Western area which is more crowded than the Eastern section. 
This property is located just across the swami narayanan temple.

Amenities- being a 4 star hotel, all amenities like swiming pool, gym, restaurant, etc

Room - the room we got was pretty spacious - had a division seperate for living and bed space, had a seperate walk in wardrobe, nice washroom and is kept very neat and clean

Overall the hotel and its staff were generally good but we felt the bell boys to be more responsible than thr reception staff as both during check in and check out we noticed the reception staff to be engrossed in their personal discussions instead of keeping Customer intrests at the prime.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d301496-r466156773-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","3","54","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manoja692","Manoj A","16504161E6D76001ED3CF45346624ABE",,"2630221","Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Emirate of Dubai","manoja692",,"General Manager","467170949","en","2017-03-14","dadarsales","Dear Guest,

"A modest hotel that is well located","4","2017-02","2017-03-01","It is essential to understand the dynamics of Mumbai while selecting a hotel. One needs to consider the location and budget while deciding the luxury. This hotel justifies its price with its central location and addressing all basic requirements one would expect from the hotel. If you are looking for a luxury hotel that is also well located then the budget will need to be atleast doubled.

This is my 3rd stay in this hotel and will be spending over 5 nights with family. The services are upto mark and dont disappoint at all. The restaurant is modest and the prices of drinks are in line with other hotels in similar range. 

If you are tourist then this is very located as the time to Bandra, Parel and Marine Drive will mostly be the same. if you are on business then you need to evaluate the hotel based on the location of your office. If your office is in South Mumbai, BKC or Dadar then this may be a good choice. 

While the hotel is a bit dated, the rooms are clean and the staff is very courteous. 

Overall, a very nice stay if one can appreciate the modesty required in Mumbai.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d301496-r463776938-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"300","239619306","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/48/4c/ea/voyagerclicks.jpg","300","66","752","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/voyagerclicks","voyagerclicks","3A26A15A9E16D299E6E3E9245BE28524",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","voyagerclicks",,"General Manager","467172974","en","2017-03-14","dadarsales","Dear Guest,

"Very unprofessional - Thinking of cancelling my booking.","1","2017-01","2017-01-09","I booked a room from Germany in a website to stay from 11th to 16th of January 2017. As per the website I booked, early check-in must be possible in this hotel. Nevertheless, they gave the phone number to verify it with the property. ie the Ramee Guestline Hotel Dadar. I was ready to pay for the extra hours that I am going to check in early.

I called the hotel to clarify about the procedures for an early checkin. Someone answered the phone. I somehow did not feel good with the irresponsible response that person gave me. The way they talked is not so polite. The person on the other end responded to my query as if she does not care if I stay in this hotel or not. So I am reconsidering to cancel my booking. Poor hospitality in their speech in general.

I highly doubt if my stay here would be ever pleasing. I would not want someone to spoil my mood like this during my 6 days of business visit to India. I do not even know if i could cancel my booking and be refunded. Because, I paid the money as a whole after reading good reviews here. But the reality is otherwise.
 I do not know about the ameneties of the hotel yet. But I sure the people who work there may not be that hospitable.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d301496-r450655746-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"50","219979371","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/1c/9e/6b/umesh-kumar-sha-r.jpg","50","7","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escape672126","umesh kumar sha... r","EC006F40233302629928A73BDE813816",,,,,"Escape672126",,"General Manager","455816601","en","2017-01-29","dadarsales","Dear Guest,

"Smell of dry fish, uffff and poorly maintained","2","2018-05","2018-05-07","A group of friends and kids visited over the weekend of 5 May. As soon as we got off a strong smell of dry fish hit us from nowhere. When we asked at reception, the ladies said by evening it wont be so bad! No choice since we had prepaid and once up to our room(2nd floor) it took 2 men from the housekeeping to open the doors to our rooms. The rooms need refurb.asap! Old bathrooms, broken toilet roll holder, leaky basin taps, mirrors above the basin in which you cannot see yourself at all! We went to the beach and the dry fish stench was so bad we came back within minutes. The fish is dried right outside the hotel at the back entrance near the beach.
Food is good. We had breakfast, lunch, tandoori, chinese starters. Pool is decent.

Reception staff seemed in sour mood and did not make us feel welcome, no smile, answered a couple of our questions with a load of attitude but we friends were in a great mood to enjoy our weekend so ignored it!

The fish smell is out of the hotel's control as the local fishermen use the beach adjacent to the hotel to dry their fish. At the hotel, we are doing our best to reduce the impact of smell by having agarbatis outside the hotel and deodorizes inside.

"Nice place for weekend getaway","4","2018-03","2018-03-25","Had a 1 night stay at this luxury hotel. Its a few miles away from the city along the road to Madh Island. So you'll get the perfect feel of a koli(fishing) village en route. Booked a pool view room and luckily it also gave a perfect view of the sea. Its right beside the Erangal beach (of Sagar movie fame). It has its own private entrance for the beach. The pool is pretty well maintained. There's a separate pool for kids so my kid enjoyed too. The rooms are also big and well maintained. The bathroom was neat and clean too (as expected from a 5 * facility.) 

The lunch and dinner buffets had a variety of dishes (both veg & non veg). Though the prices were on the higher side, the food quality was good. The staff is also very courteous. 

The bed mattress can be better though. Its a spring mattress and gave us backaches. Otherwise the bed size was big enough for a couple and a kid. 

This place has its own convention center, gym, massage parlor & kids play area too. So a good location for company outings as well.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r568786886-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452391174","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","1200","8","41","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArnabChakravorty","ArnabChakravorty","D1C1D1CA5A754CF895DFF272B0862982",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","ArnabChakravorty",,"Manager","573376763","en","2018-04-14","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Keep expectations low and you'll like it","3","2018-03","2018-03-16","Good property although there is all pervading stench of rotten fish all over, because of the fishing boats bringing in their haul on the beach adjoining the property. The highlight is the wonderfully maintained pool with a little waterfall, sunken bar, a hot tub jacuzzi and a cute little island bang in the middle of the pool. The staff does make an effort but service leaves a lot to be desired...especially the security at the gate who went sniffing into the car, which was awkward as my elderly aunt and 10 year old niece was with us. 
As for food, stay away from the Chinese and its ok...average in quality and service. 
There aren't any outdoor activities for children so unless one is in the pool, there isn't anything to do outside for children. There is some arrangement for indoor games. 
The rooms are fine and the pool facing rooms allow one to wake up to a lovely view.
If one is not expecting great stuff and is ok with average, then this is a fine place for a weekend stay over.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r566958869-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"851","250234044","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/ea/44/bc/ruparoy.jpg","851","12","211","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruparoy","ruparoy","0BEE428E87A903240B2CC1195B75A1BC",,"293860","India","India","ruparoy",,"Manager","573376625","en","2018-04-14","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Nice property, attentive service, rooms need improvement","3","2018-03","2018-03-05","We were looking for a one-day getaway on a long weekend AND didn't want crowds! That's like asking for the moon! But we found a perfect hide-out right in our backyard! The Retreat was just 35 km from where we stay. It still takes an hour an half to get there. Best is to let a cabbie drive you there.
Nicely maintained property especially the lawns and the swimming pool. Attentive help, especially our pool attendant. The pool is the highlight. Multiple sections. Not very deep, so can't dive or do professional swimming but for most, it is more than adequate. Beautiful waterfall in the pool that massages you. A small jacuzzi with heated water too.
The restaurant (Oriental Bowl for dinner) was nice. Spacious, and because there were few people, quiet and perfect for our needs.
The breakfast was average though. Again, the staff was very attentive and responsive.
The negatives were:
1. A strong smell of drying fish hits you as soon as you come up to the hotel lobby. The smell does disappear once you are on the premises and does not come up again.
2. The rooms are very spacious but not very well maintained. Definitely could improve.
3. What was most objectionable was that the basin tap had salty water coming out of it. They provide only one! Small bottle of mineral water per room per day. They do offer unlimited RO potable water, but you need to keep asking for refills.
4. And a big no-no! - There is no free wi-fi! They charge for everything. What they fail to realize is that data is so cheap! It costs nothing except goodwill to provide free wifi. In any case, each mobile has tons of data available, so will somebody ever subscribe to their wifi???!!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r564573624-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452389859","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","1200","31","33","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nathanir","Rajesh Nathani","A331C9AC57C5C9BE5AAB20C14C7DFEDD",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","nathanir",,"Manager","573376520","en","2018-04-14","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Sad experience! ","1","2018-03","2018-03-03","1. Property- The property is decent, but has lost most of its charm. A bad whiff of fishes resonates throughout the grounds though they take failed efforts by burning incense at some places.

2. Room- The interiors of the room are alright with us having got a “palm-facing” view which is nothing but a sad view of the parking lot. The AC system kept making a buzzing sound through the night, which caused a disturbed sleep. 

3. Food- The food tastes very average with only the Malabari Fish Curry tasting like it is supposed to taste. No idea why their food is so darned expensive! To top it all, after having the lunch buffet the second day, my husband fell ill with multiple bouts of loose motions throughout the night with us getting very little sleep due to it. 

4. Staff behaviour- The front desk is not trained well on speaking with the guests. Rude and unprofessional. We did not even get proper clarity on our bill break up. We checked out and left in anger without the front desk giving two hoots about our disappointment. The other staff is good though. 

5. Verdict- We are never coming back here.

"Amazing Stay . Must go","4","2018-01","2018-02-01","It was a fantastic stay in Retreat. Awesome Service, hospitality and nice rooms. Rooms were spacious and had comfortable design. View overlooking the palm trees were serene. Limited spread in buffet but quality and taste were very good. Only issue I felt that the pool water temperature was not maintained, felt it cold especially for my family members and kid. jacuzzi was awesome though

Overall a great stay ","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r557842789-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"50","121758745","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/41/e4/19/tushar-a.jpg","50","6","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tushar367","tushar367","66376CBDB2463E2F1676C2B2B2DB35F0",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","tushar367",,"Manager","562431259","en","2018-02-23","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Good Resort for Business Meetings/Family Trip","4","2018-01","2018-01-28","I have attended business group meeting at The Retreat in Jan18.Good place with meeting hall,Greenary, swimming pool along beach in front of Resort.
Food quality good with professional staff. Building maintenance require improvement but rooms are good.

One can plan family trip on weekends. Children will definitely enjoy game activities, swimming in big pool, walking on grass or enjoying nature under tree watching different birds sitting near pool or playing on beach.
Morning walk on clean /less crowded beach is worth for early risers.

Food is little costly.I suggest hotel management to come out with combo food preparation.This will help your resort only and people can visit again....","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d655103-r557005696-The_Retreat_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452390771","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1200","88","84","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TKuldeep","TKuldeep","172251307418E480F23EA2323484A840",,,,,"TKuldeep",,"Manager","562431095","en","2018-02-23","The_Retreat_Mumbai","Dear Guest,

"Average rooms, great location, good food.","3","2013-12","2014-04-27","I stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights and had an average experience. First off, the location is excellent. It is walking distance from Churchgate station and really close to Colaba as well. 
The hotel looks and feels really old. All the furniture and the interior is quite dates. Having said this, I suppose it contributes to the charm of the hotel. The staff is adequately helpful but they don't go out of the way to be polite. 
The rooms are very spacious and the beds are okay. I must point out again that all the furniture, fixture, cupboards and dressers etc are very old and dated. The bathrooms have been modernized with marble/granite and are decent. I must say the the floors of the room were not very clean. 
The restaurant downstairs has really nice food. The spread is value for money and the food is quite fresh and tasty.That's the hotel in a nutshell - old hotel, polite staff, excellent location, very nice food.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r203003093-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452391659","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg","1200","9","29","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tas_16_98","tas_16_98","BF5B7206C3DEB7D5A11785C9B8D1E34B",,"297586","Hyderabad, India","Hyderabad","tas_16_98",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"
"Not value for price","3","2014-02","2014-03-21","Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in Feb-14. The location is pretty good, if you have work in South Mumbai. However, for the room price, the facilities are not upto the mark. The lift is British-era and definitely needs replacement. I was given a corner room and the room was spacious, and the bathroom was great. However, the bed and bedsheets etc. were quite old. Room service was prompt, however, the charges were exorbitant and the quantities were less than expected.
The staff is very nice and courteous.
However, I would recommend people to find a cheaper alternative if they plan to stay in South Mumbai.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r198196373-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"2048","735401298","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/d5/55/52/caption.jpg","2048","51","89","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/majumdar_kuntal","Kuntal Majumdar","76107AE3CBEE6DD754989FCB097134B9",,"294009","Doha, Qatar","Doha","majumdar_kuntal",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"

"Comfortable place, good location","4","2013-12","2014-02-22","I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel in December 2013. I landed up at 6 am and they checked me into my room without slapping any extra charges for early arrival (which most hotels would have done) and that was great. The establishment dates back to 1947, the year India got independence and the management clearly wants to preserve this old-world charm, which I very much appreciated. My (double) room was quite spacious and clean. I especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the morning, which was very extensive, with many cooked dishes. I remember the lunch buffet being great as well. Since this is an old building, there was some issue with the light bulbs etc, but the management fixed it up very well. The only unreasonable part was the wifi, which I had to pay for, and which was quite expensive, around Rs 160/hour, if I remember correctly. Other than that, a great experience.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r194993004-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452389422","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","1200","11","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Titiksha","Titiksha","DA7A3C88B61889379469416E663AA7C7",,"293997","Manama, Bahrain","Manama","Titiksha",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"
"The west end ?","3","2014-02","2014-02-15","It isn't. The first impression on walking in, its a throwback to the 80s. I asked the receptionist about this. he said the owners want to keep it that way. Some may like it, I didn't. Having said that, the rooms were clean and large(not found in this area), furniture is antique or dated(take your pick), room service was prompt, AC worked well and toilet was clean with hot water from the shower in plenty. Sleep quality was not bad but there was a little traffic noise.A tea-heater would be nice in the rooms and it would help if the wifi was free. Breakfast is a buffet but forget taste, it was lousy. The immediate area around the hotel isn't the best. Lots of beggars but I never felt unsafe, just pestered. Stay here again ?

The room was spacious and pretty clean. We had a problem with no cold water in the shower which was fixed immediately. Room service was excellent, extremely quick and efficient. The restaurant was expensive for what you get - breakfast was average. You also have to pay for wifi which always feels like a cheek when a lot of lower priced hotels offer it for free. The man who checked us in on reception was very abrupt and brusque and answered every question as if you should know the answer. He also told us you have to have a separate wifi voucher for each device - not true!! So don't listen - other than him the service really was great though.

"Solid choice based on cost","3","2013-01","2013-12-02","I first stayed here in March 2009 and have been there on and off for the following 2 years. It is not by choice, but rather due to cost. An average room costs around $120.00 NZ a night. AC is noisy, the rooms are very basic, room service is ridiculously expensive, breakfast menu is berry berry predictable BUT and there is a very big BUT..... The location compared to almost other triple the price hotels is very central and the staff (from the front desk, room service, lift boys to the car parking attendants) are amazing.....
When you enter the lobby, it feels like you have honestly stepped back in time.....huge big fans, decor to match and all that is missing is the ladies with fringe hats and the gentlemen looking dapper smoking cigars....

Rooms
Above average in size that normally has an AC window that has a bucket to catch excess water and that needs to be emptied daily. They do have baby cots, but I wouldn't recommend as I saw them repaint one with lead paint. There are smoking floors and the smell if you walk down the stairs is vulgar. 

Room service
Costs an arm and a leg. Like most hotels, the food is bland and generic. The indian food is a combination of western/india and the continental food is the same lol..... Generally room service is quick and you can ask for just about anything. I called reception and asked if someone could go and get some medicine for me as my baby was asleep and it was no trouble. Granted that the Bombay Hospital is opposite and there are literally hundreds of chemists/pharmacys everywhere.

Environment
As the hotel is located next to the Bombay Hospital, outside there are literally hundreds of people with all sorts of ailments. Generally the noise level in the room is fine, although the AC can be at times noisy. If there is a function on the top floor/terrace - this will change.....the elevator will be blocked for hours as it is small and houses maybe 4 or 5 at a push and the music is unbelievably loud - but will finish at around 11 or 12. 

Security
I always felt safe both in and around the hotel. I would often go for walks in the evening with my 2 children and although there are beggars, street dwellers and sick people I never felt unsafe. One of the hotel boys if asked will accompany you up and down the street for quick supplies. 

Car Parking and or transport
Taxis live outside the hotel so you will always find a cab. Get the price per km first before you even hop in. 
If you have a car although parking is limited the attendants will find you a place. 

Do not go cheaper and book with Hotel Sapna or Hotel Fortune which is about a 2 minute walk away....the rooms are a quarter, no, no an eighth of the size and although looks cleanish...they both certainly are not....

I have to add that the majority of people that stayed here while I was there seemed to be business people. I was there with my husband and 2 children (2 years and 9 months) and as noted earlier we stayed there on and off for about 2 years (possibly a total of 10 stays). This was due to us visiting Mumbai to oversee our house being renovated. The staff always accomodated our needs, bringing hot water to heat bottles, using bottled water to wash and sterilise bottles, heating baby food for us etc.....","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r186526260-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"21","19","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelarhanaaririaa","RachaelArhanaar...

"“ Quaint and Cosy  ”","4","2016-07","2016-07-27","As I was in Mumbai for a conference , I chose this hotel as it was closest to KEM hospital. In terms of location, it is located just next to Swami Narayan temple , so it is easy to get to.
The hotel is quaint and petite ....everything is located so very close to each other from the doorway to the reception area and breakfast room. The people at the reception are very helpful at any given time and as I had an online booking , I had no delays in being checked in once they verified my booking . ( I’d like to mention that Nidha at the reception was very polite ,helpful and so very jolly , as were the other staff at the reception and breakfast hall). For the tourists/backpackers that are looking for an economical stay , this hotel is apt as it comes with all the amenities and it is surrounded by a variety of shops and the Swami Narayan temple that many people flock to.
I was given the room on the 5th floor. I had booked the club room with two single beds. The view was....well of the opposite building which you can expect when in Mumbai.There are two chairs kept facing the window which is quite nice when you sit down for tea in the evenings. The room floor I found to be a tad dirty with stains here and there but can be ignored if you are not too finicky about it. The various snacks kept within the room were over priced especially if one knows the actual prices of these items outside. The bathroom is clean but if you are travelling with older people , like parents or grandparents , the shower is a bit tedious to get to and one can easily slip as there are no wet mats placed outside the bath tub area.
 The bed linen surprisingly was clean, with few to no stains and the air conditioning fully functional. In this quaint hotel I found something very unique .There are three buttons located near the key card area ; Make up room /Laundry/Do not disturb ... so if by mistake you press any of these three buttons, then you can be sure that before you return from breakfast your room will be cleaned and beds made .     
The breakfast buffet was a let down I have to say. There are South Indian items like dosa , idli and vada . On one day there were pooris served which I found to be very oily and not very edible .The croissants and cupcakes served were very stale both the days. The curd kept was very sour on both days . I did not venture out to eat the various cereals that were laid out. The fruits were the only saving grace on the menu. On the second day of my stay I wanted my eggs sunny side up /bulls eye but I found the white part of the egg to be undercooked , which I brought to the attention of the waiter but all he did was flip the egg over and fry it on both sides....its a small thing but could have been handled better.
The hotel has a pool on the roof but on both the days I was there , the pool was locked up ...which was a little disappointing. The gym area is too small for more than 2 people to be working out in.
Good hotel for short stays ...and quite economical.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d301496-r398252978-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","13","99","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrthoDoc2016","OrthoDoc2016","AC01FD2D25A462D402530BF120B560CA",,"297630","Mangalore, India","Mangalore","OrthoDoc2016",,,,,,,,"Opp. Swami Narayan Temple Dadar (E), Mumbai, Mumbai 400014 India","Mumbai","India","400014","Maharashtra","Opp. Swami Narayan Temple","Dadar (E), Mumbai","301496","19.017252","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.84463","Ramee Guestline Dadar Hotel","310","3.9","18","12","67","109","105","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d301496-Reviews-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.rameehotelsindia.com/guestline-dadar-mumbaihotel.aspx"

This is exactly how Ramee Dadar treats their guests.  The staff is very informative and don't mind answering your questions.

We requested a downgrade to a regular room, which was a little better.

split AC pointed on your head, 
blankets in place of comforters, 
bad pillows, 
worn down furniture and amenities which would be luxury when launched some 100 years ago, walkway filled with beggars and destitute – not something that you can keep up with or it can remind of some old charm.

"Older hotel with special charm","4","2013-01","2013-01-07","We stayed at the WEH on the recommendation of a physician at the Bombay Hospital ( across the street) where a family member was hospitalized. This hotel is  old for sure, but has clean rooms that are large by European standards. The furniture is old, but clean, the bed was comfortable, each floor has a housekeeping attendant who you buzz if anything is needed. 3rd and 4th floor are non smoking, and AC ( which was very loud, but worked) is in the room.  Guests ran the gammut from business travelers, European holiday travelers, solo and group, Indians, Africans, Asians. WIFI is by purchase- ( 700 ruppees for 7 hours time).  The shower is great- hot water with real pressure. You are provided small bars of soap and a small packet of shampoo, and each shower has a supply of shower gel in a dispenser. Its location is good for venturing out with quite a few eateries along the surrounding streets. This is old Bombay. I must say the resstaurant in this hotel - ""The Gourmet Restaurant"" is great.Classic decor, with old world service - very fresh ingedients for both indian and continental menus and you can order a drink from the bar with dinner. The service is beyond compare- it is restraunteuring the way it was years ago. It is frequented by locals and hotel guests. There is also a nice buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner.

The rooms are very spacious, clean and bathrooms have an excellent shower. The attendant staff on my floor were delightfully attentive, extremely helpful and those on the reception went out of their way to make my stay as pleasurable as possible. As an example, when I was unsure as to the location of a particular place, the person on reception went online and personally called the place to find a local landmark that I could give the taxi driver to make sure I got there ok!! There is an olde world grace and charm to this hotel, with its bellboys and restaurant staff in their pristine uniforms. I know there are glitzier places in Mumbai that probably have more modern fixtures and fittings, but i'd much rather stay in this charming hotel with a soul than somewhere more glamorous but possessed of a cold and indifferent demeanour.

"Mittelklassehotel zum Luxuspreis","2","2012-09","2012-09-11","Habe dieses Hotel auf Grund der relativ guten Bewertungen bei Tripadvisor gebucht. Kann aber nicht verstehen, wie man dieses Hotel so gut bewerten kann. Als ich das Zimmer betrat war ich erst mal geschockt. Ein kahler gefliesster Raum mit einem schmuddligen Teppich. Im Zimmer, wie auch im ganzen Hotel war ein Geruch nach Mottenkugeln. Das Zimmer hat keinen Kuehlschrank! Alle elektrischen Leitungen sind aufputz verlegt.Die Zimmertuer laesst jeden Laerm durch. Neben meinem Zimmer war auch noch das Servicezimmer. Da ich ein Zimmer nach hinten hatte hielt sich der Laerm von aussen in Grenzen. Enstrechend ar allerdings der Anblick. Das Zimmer ist auch im Lonely Planet empfohlen (Midrange). Aber der Preis passt nicht zum Hotel.

Das Fruehstueck war ok. Allerdings lief eine Kuechenschabe ueber das Tischtuch.

Einziger Vorteil ist in meinen Augen die zentrale Lage.Aber wenn man vor die Tuer geht dann muss man erst mal ueber die campierenden Inder auf dem Gehsteig. NIcht gerade die beste Strasse.

Fazit: Das naechste mal lieber wieder in eine internationale Kette. Da kann man sich auf die Qualitaet verlassen, auch in Indien.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d309525-r139994014-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452391174","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","1200","22","33","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schwammerlfanger","schwammerlfanger","E0076A6061A3D57C1B8D2670FECD57F5",,"229466","Landshut, Germany","Landshut","schwammerlfanger",,,,,,,,"45 New Marine Lines, Mumbai 400020 India","Mumbai","India","400020","Maharashtra","45 New Marine Lines",,"309525","18.940632","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.82763","West End Hotel","273","3.6","14","18","74","111","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d309525-Reviews-West_End_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","http://www.westendhotelmumbai.com/"

"un hôtel à l'ancienne...","4","2012-04","2012-04-30","Hôtel parfaitement bien situé à Colaba, dans l'extrême sud de Mumbai. Légèrement en retrait. On nous a donné une suite un peu vieillotte mais très confortable et surtout très propre. Pas de clim mais des ventilateurs dans le salon et la chambre. Nous coupions les ventilateurs pour dormir et ma fois nous n'avions pas trop chaud. La salle de bain était très bien avec une vraie baignoire. Le restaurant où nous avons déjeuné le premier jour offrait une belle carte pas trop chère, et de la bière fraîche... Ce qui est rare dans ce quartier plutôt musulman et aux excellents restaurants végétariens... Le personnel est très prévenant, les taxis devant l'hôtel évitent la marche à la recherche d'un véhicule: le portier explique au chauffeur où nous souhaitons aller, les liftiers sont charmants et souriants. Il est possible d'aller à pied de l'hôtel à la gare de Churchgate (500 mètres) voir l'arrivée de Dabbawalla à 11h30 et leur retour à 14h30. C'est un spectacle incroyable. On peut aussi aller à pied à IndiaGate, sur Marine Drive... C'est un endroit assez calme et proche de tout ce qu'on peut visiter à Mumbaï . J'ajouterai que je n'ai pas vu de bestioles bizarres! tout était parfaitement propre bien qu'un peu vieillot.J'ajouterai aussi que la gentillesse du personnel et de la direction est très agréable: nous devions quitter l'hôtel à 5h du matin pour prendre un avion, on nous a apporté dans la chambre à 4h 30 un excellent petit déjeuner!

"Poor Service","3","2016-02","2016-02-11","Though I have stayed in Ramme Dubai hotel and wrote a positive review, I am little disappointed by Its Dadar branch. Last year I stayed in same hotel and had a reasonably OK experience but this time I did not enjoy my stay. Some staff lacks basic hospitality attitude and restaurant has poor service. In breakfast a simple order I placed (and I spoke to two separate persons) could not be served in 30 mins, as I was getting late, I left. Reception staff too needs to be little more polite. Room (single bed-room) is little small and first few floor give poor view.

"A nice hotel to line up to!","4","2016-02","2016-02-06","Recently I stayed here for three nights on a business trip and here is my feedback.

The Good:

-	Location: Right in front of Swami Narayan Mandir, right next to Dadar Railway station, this hotel is in the heart of a commercial district. 
-	Great food joints to have different kinds of food be it Udupi style or Punjabi
-	Three very good Vada pav joints within a minute walking distance from the hotel. Gorge yourself with Vada pav and related snacks
-	Many mouth watering street vendors right outside the hotel making fresh Dosas, Sandwiches, Chat etc
-	The rooms are well done and well furnished
-	The bathroom is well maintained. Was impressed with immediately outflow of hot water from the shower.
-	The AC works perfectly
-	The mattresses and pillows are very comfortable, giving you the most required, good night’s sleep.
-	A DVD player is a a surprise addition to the room amenities
-       The Wi-Fi was quite good & fast

The Bad:

-	the breakfast spread and taste is quite ordinary. Hard Idlis,  tasteless chutneys disappoint you right in the morning. The fresh Dosa they offer is a saving grace
-	It is not a hotel built grounds up. It has been clearly refurbished. All the wood and furnishings can make you feel a bit crowded 
-	The prices are slightly on the higher side, which I guess, is mainly for the location.

The Ugly:

-	Nothing that I can think of.

Overall Verdict: Definitely a hotel, worth staying, both for the families and business travellers. The overall positives outweigh the negatives.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d301496-r345512893-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452392144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","1200","68","104","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vishmon","Vishmon","8C685FAB39A9DF05D7B034FE7A940E87",,,,,"Vishmon",,"Manager","378536313","en","2016-06-01","dadarsales","Dear Guest,

"Excellent Service in a great price","5","2015-10","2016-01-22","The reason I say it is excellent is because I had to pay only 1500 per room I could get what I could wish for. The room had an attached bathroom. It was clean and hygienic. We were a group of 5 adults and a kid. So we booked two rooms and things were smooth. We anyway did not want a room with too many luxury as we were gonna be in the room only to sleep over in night and have a wash after we come from the beach.

The beach is just 'Cross the Road' distance away. The owner of the guest house also provide lunch & dinner was at reasonable cost.

However this time it was really bad. I had booked two rooms well in advance for my family. However we were allotted two rooms on different floors. Instead of a double bed, two bedded rooms were allotted. Worst still, there was a lot of noise during the night till 5 am in the morning because of a marriage party perhaps. Booking in advance could not save us from all these. I have decided not to stay here again.

"Great stay and courteous staff","3","2015-10","2015-10-24","Stay date: 07 Oct 2015 till 18 Oct 2015
Room: 406

Got to use the services for 11 days and here is the feedback

Positives
1. Helpful staff and smiling always
2. Food is great both room service and restaurant serving breakfast
3. Breakfast spread is decent
4. WiFi is great but at times fluctuated during the stay
5. Location is excellent... Right next to dadar station
6. Check in and check out was smooth

Negatives
1. Only hotel I have ever seen so far charging you ~Rs 100 for ice. Very surprised
2. While no comments for for pricing but a bottles of Pepsi with a market rate of Rs 40 was charged at ~Rs 250.
3. Quality of linen needs to approve as there were stains observed thrice during the stay on towels and need sheets. Got it changed
4. With due respect to the individual, the house keeping staff collecting laundry had a bandage on his hand. Suggest the hotel refrain then from customer interfacing roles and use them for backend job

Cheers

"No value for money","2","2015-04","2015-06-18","I stayed in this hotel for a duration of about 2 weeks in the month of April 2015. The hospitality is very poor, the hotel doesn't provide pickups from the railway station and the behavior of the reception staff is very rude. The rooms are very small in the first 6 floors and also the bathrooms haven't been maintained well.

"terrible experience","1","2015-05","2015-05-05","I stayed in executive room on 4th May night. The drainage pipe in the bathroom was chocked and this leads to overflow of water all over. The room service was very poor. The plates in the room were not cleared after dinner despite reminding room service three times. I found one hotel boy in my room in the morning in my absence when I came back from breakfast. Front office executive told me that they have duplicate access card and they check the room during the absence of the guests that whether they are there or left the hotel. Really strange. This is not a secure environment for guests and their belongings. Anyone can enter the room anytime !!
Above all front office executive is not customer friendly and not ready to listen anything. I will never recommend this hotel to any one.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d301496-r270286524-Ramee_Guestline_Dadar_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452389307","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","1200","3","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashunew","ashunew","AA95ED78814F0E8E21E62FC93D6B4B59",,"297602","National Capital Territory of Delhi, India","National Capital Territory of Delhi","ashunew",,"General Manager","273609216","en","2015-05-21","dadarsales","Dear Guest,
