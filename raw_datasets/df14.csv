Front desk manager tried to check the room availability and asked to us wait as the rooms were not clean. They gave a very small room for 3 adults. Full hotel was stinking badly. Lot of mosquitos in the room and no hygiene. House keeping staff just threw the bad in the room and went. 

Very bad experience and horrible hotel. Bathrooms are horrible. Curtains and flooring of the room is dirty.

"Think this is a bad hotel? It is worst than that.","1","2017-12","2017-12-05","I didn't like this hotel, and I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. Front staff not attentive. Room is dusty, smells musty and very old. Ancient. Pillows are ancient and full of disgusting yellow stains. Pillow cases had various types of stains, including blood, and a series of weird indescribable large and small stains -- yellow, purple, etc. Very old and tired bedding. Bed corners full of dust and little piles probably due to years of accumulation of exfoliated skin cells and other detritus.  Dust bunnies around the corners of the room, a hairball on the bathroom rug.  The bedding is so disgusting that I decided to encase a pillow on one of my t-shirts before going to bed. I also  decided to sleep on my long sleeves and jeans so i don't get my skin touching the numerous disgusting stains that I saw -- and the ones i didn't see. Wearing long sleeves and pants are also a good protection from the population of mosquitoes in the room--after I laid down mosquitoes tried to bite me. Note to self -- bring more DEET or malaria pills. The only bathroom light was broken -- which in a way was good: it makes it hard to see the other possible stains. But major problems with the bathroom were that the bathroom ceramics (sink and bowl) had major yellow stains--probably mineralization due to age. Bath Tub had numerous stained cracks and corners had weird yellow things accumulated.  Bring your own water--they announce that the hotel will provide ""crystalline pure water"" but that's not true -- no bottled water in the bedroom. Overall the brown decor (curtains and furniture) with dark brown motifs from the 70's has aged well and shows the appropriate signs of the long decades of hard use and lack of sanitary care.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r545351808-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"1200","452386713","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","1200","2","28","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agenorm2017","Agenor M","3AF3E9EDC3696DB7BC5DBAD10A08FC37",,,,,"agenorm2017",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"
"Average hotel with average things to offer!","3","2017-11","2017-12-02","The check in was fast and okay. The staff at the reception did not even offer to take the baggage to room as a courtesy. The hotel rooms are oddly shaped with not so great view. The bathrooms are not that spacious too. The bedding is soft nice however the AC is central and only thing we can control is the blower which makes exceptionally loud sound. 
I had a fluffy omelette in the evening to snack on and that was delicious! Did not have dinner though but had very high hopes for breakfast the next day.
I went with very high hopes for breakfast but was highly disappointed. The options were few and whatever was offered was not upto the mark. The Dhokla was undercooked and the poha was over fried, the omelette was thin and the toast was not toasted at all. After having dhokla I did not even think of having idli sambar.
The check out was smooth, however there was spelling mistake even though I had provided my ID proof etc. So was disappointing that the receptionist had one task to do which he could not do properly.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r544615569-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"50","274948416","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/63/61/40/patildh07.jpg","50","7","78","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patildh07","BeyondPixel","115D970B5AE12FF6C91C48A7FA00F707",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","patildh07",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

"Okay for the price","3","2016-10","2016-10-07","Got a good deal while booking this hotel. Had requested for early check in and same was done in no time at all. The rooms are a bit dated and smell of mold. apparently they have recently undergone an upgradation but the rooms show very little signs of the same. Floorboards in the hallway are creaky. Rooms are okay in size but bathrooms are too tiny. 
The thermostat for the central A/C has only a knob and temperature cannot be controlled, only the flow can be reduced a bit. Not a very good night's sleep there.
Location is very good, located on the busy C.G road and lots of eateries around.
Only had the buffet breakfast which was seriously limited in choices. 
Did not try the in-room dining.
Can be visited if on an official trip or for a short trip where you stay only to sleep.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r426020124-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"1783","724786380","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/33/5c/cc/shehwaz.jpg","1783","193","1120","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shehwaz","Shehwaz","36C26B202EAFBFC5519BD5D6EF59786B",,"297608","Ahmedabad, India","Ahmedabad","shehwaz",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

The Taj Inn is a lovely hotel. Check in was quick and efficient, reception staff were extremely helpful and professional and our room, 202 did not disappoint. The room was a generous size with   a large bed complete with nice white sheets. There was a fridge with hospitality tray, WiFi and a really big shower room with body wash and soap and a hairdryer. . We had both aircon and fan although we used neither as Agra is quite chilly at this time of the year.

"Ticks most boxes","4","2024-01","2024-01-30","Great place - it has a very polished, upmarket feel. Shower was sensational and my bed was comfortable although I did have to flip over the mattress (always a good hack in old hotels). Staff were friendly and breakfast was simple but nice. Location is on a main road a bit away from the Taj area but still fine for Ubers etc.

Less impressed with the rooftop restaurant. They were playing blaring loud dance music even though there were only a couple of tables in.

Для делюкса считаю это неприемлемым.  Полотенца сильно воняли хлоркой. Вкусно кормят. Повторю что в сравнении с 3* в Дели, это отличный отель. Читала что жалуются на музыку. Я была в будние дни.

"Worst Hotel","1","2023-02","2023-02-15","I don’t even think they even deserve one star. We came from USA and did the booking in Holiday Inn. We were driving and got late and our booking got canceled. My wife found this hotel from internet and came here. She booked family suite. Came here and our first interaction with Ajit. Ajit told that there will be 1000 rupees extra for extra adult. We agreed. We told we have 4 kids and they are all under age of 10. He told it will be fine and there will be no charges for kids. We checked the room and came downstairs and Ajit changed his story. The General Manager Darbar Khan said that it will be 4500 for kids. My wife told that first we were being told something different. Darbar Khan was very rude and his behavior was very inappropriate. His voice was very loud and my kids to give I.D. My kids did not understand Hindi. Instead of providing suite, he gave us two different deluxe room. Charged us for Taj view, where you can not even see anything. My wife asked Darbar Khan to give Managing Director number or email which he never provided. I wish i never paid him. I am stuck here for next two days. I wish the M.D see this review and hope he can talk to us. Darbar Khan you are one of the worst person I have ever met. You should not be in this position. Horrible customer service. Please think before you even consider staying in this hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d6772837-r878866692-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452389307","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","1200","4","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless45670699876","Fearless45670699876","1E1442D9E317D76394A8B3AACF0081CA",,"297683","Agra, India","Agra","Fearless45670699876",,"General Manager","879397514","en","2023-02-19","DARAB KHAN","Dear Valued Guest,,

Apology for the inconvenience caused to you during your stay. 
But Sir i would like to inform you about certain shortcomings from your side when you entered the hotel you had 3 bookings out of which you had to go with one. The booking was for 2 adults but you guys were 3 adults and 4 kids above 10-12 years 
First you showed first voucher which is suite room booking 2 adult then you said you want to see the room then receptionist show round the room
After that you said we have booked another room whose price is less. Then you said we want to see that room too then receptionist show round the room according to different booking voucher then again you said you have third booking for basic category then again receptionist show round the room according to different booking voucher after that receptionist asked sir please tell me how many room you want and how many person you have. Because the booking was pay at hotel  then you said we are 3 adults and 4 small children and get us a one room only Then the receptionist said sir ok you take a room but 3rd adult will be charged extra so call your family from car because your family was in parking  Then when your family came inside the hotel you had 3 adults and 4 kids above 10-12 years .The receptionist asked Sir, you had said that your children are small, but according to the policy, these children are chargeable then you said no these children are 4 years old While the children were of 10-12 years, then receptionist said, if it is so, please give the proof. after that you became so aggressive After that coincidentally i was passing through the lobby so i see you are being very aggressive then I did personally  and very polite solved  your problem as per discussion you take 2 room double for 4 people  and we charge 2 children only and 1 children we will make it complimentary  
And we didn't even have an argument with you; yes you were initially aggressive towards the receptionist

If you felt that we are wrong On that time, then I am extremely sorry for that

"The worst hotel in Agra","1","2022-11","2022-11-17","I give one star because I can't give less. Not worth the price.  Dirty everywhere, hairs and stains on sheets and floors. Lots of people walking around doing nothing. Very rude reception. Breakfasts is a joke, empty kitchen heaters in the breakfast area, stale milk. Staff don't speak English at all (including managers) and don't know how to fry an egg. Couldn't try restaurant food as was too loud to hear the waiter.

"They don't know what hospitality is","3","2021-12","2021-12-24","We chose this hotel because of their restaurant/pub Hichki. We had come only for a weekend. When we went to Hichki and had dinner there, after a while when the DJ had just started they asked us to leave because they wanted new people to come. Ofcourse so that they could earn more. We couldn't even enjoy the dance. We had also spent a good amount on food and drinks, not like we were sitting for free. Infact we were paying for an accomodation in their hotel. We were not disturbing any guests. 
They were not polite about it. They could have found a solution where we could have stayed and they could have had space for more people too. Or just let us enjoy! 
We could have stayed near tourist places but we chose this place for Hichki and we couldn't even have a great time there. 
The staff was very indifferent during breakfast. 
1/10 on hospitality.  one point they gain only because of their cleaning staff who helped us with the cleaning of our room. 

Also their bathroom was not clean. 

Also the rooms we stayed in had no windows. So if someone needs a window or is claustrophobic please ask if the room will have a window before you book. Some rooms have I think.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d6772837-r822949568-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452391174","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","1200","3","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKatyal13","Sonal Katyal","19C66B7C78074A9135BD4DEF48CE9569",,,,,"SKatyal13",,"General Manager","876726238","en","2023-01-29","DARAB KHAN","Dear  Valued Guest,,

The drive to Ahmedabad was decent, this was the first stretch where we saw fatalities on the road (two incidents). There are a few stretches that need caution on this stretch. Its one of the most busiest stretch.

Comfort Inn President was strongly recommended by my friend. It is right in the heart of the city. Its a business hotel, and most of the residents seemed to be airport transit folks. 

All in all the stay was comfortable. Except that the room size was definitely smaller than what we had experienced in earlier hotels of the trip. Other than that everything else was reasonably good.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r409109166-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"480","211957515","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/a2/37/0b/ad0312.jpg","480","74","449","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ad0312","AmD","19BF1077CD75FDA636C59ACEEC429A96",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","ad0312",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

"Average Business Hotel for 1 night stay","3","2016-04","2016-05-05","Well, I am a regular travel all across India, mainly on business trips requiring overnight stay. So when my company booked this hotel I expected decent property as usual for the price. Entered the lobby in the evening, was pleasantly surprised with the nicely done lobby area and helpful front desk staff. Assisted me in getting liquor permit and wonderfully the liquor shop was within hotel premises. That was nice.

Was very disappointed with the room, not with the size but overall maintenance. Filthy doormats, spotted linen was what welcomed me in the room. Staff was courteous but seemed to lack training. They seemed more suited for a low budget hotel not a budget business hotel. Food was very average. The worst was they charged me for Ice buckets, now who does that, small amount of Rs. 50 per bucket if I recall correctly, but which hotel charges for the same. Not in my life till this time.

Overall average to above average rating. Ok if your are travelling alone for a 1 night business trip.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r370574358-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,,,,,"3","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saurabh1979","Saurabh1979","2FC328509FFBB100BDEB2893DCA395E0",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Saurabh1979",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

"Praktisches Stopover-Hotel","3","2015-11","2016-01-19","Allgemeine Einschätzung im Vgl zu den Sternen
Die Zimmer und die Gesamtausstattung des Hotels entsprechen 3 Sternen. Von der Hotelhalle bis zu den Zimmern ist alles eher zweckmäßig eingerichtet. Wenn man aber nur übernachten will, dann macht es durchaus Sinn, dieses Hotel zu buchen.

Lage des Hotels
Das Hotel liegt zentral, direkt um die Ecke ist eine Einkaufsstraße und mehrere Banken, ein sog liquor-shop findet sich in der Parterre des Gebäudes

Ausstattung (Rezeption, Aufenthaltsräume, Zimmer, Restaurant)
Die Ausstattung des Hotels ist von einfacher Qualität. Man merkt den Möbeln und sonstigen Ausstattungsgegenständen Verschleißerscheinungen an. Da das Hotel ziemlich verwinkelt gebaut ist, gehen viele Zimmer auf einen Innenbereich oder eine Seitenstraße, was  aber durchaus kein Nachteil sein muss. Man hat zwar keinen akzeptablen Ausblick, dafür aber eine ruhige Nacht.

Sauberkeit,Funktionalität der Ausstattung
Wenn man indische Maßstäbe anlegt, dann war das Hotel sauber, allzu genau hingucken sollte man aber nicht. Wie in fast allen besuchten Hotels liefen im TV nur indische Sender. Zumindest hier hätte ich Deutsche Welle oder BBC erwartet. FREE WiFi war vorhanden.

Service
Nichts Auffälliges, alles im Rahmen des Normalen

Qualität des Essen
Das Hotelrestaurant bot gute indische Küche, preiswertes  Essen, eine umfangreiche Speisekarte, sogar nichtvegetarisches Essen, und das will in Gujarat etwas heißen. Der Service war aufmerksam und bemüht. Bei zwei Besuchen waren wir die einzigen Gäste.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r341165114-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"79","36135408","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/27/61/f0/winontours.jpg","79","89","267","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winontours","winontours","26A3831F5517275B6AEE761ADFC92C08",,,,,"winontours",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"
"Not bad overall, but...","3","2015-11","2015-12-01","They have a decent restaurant downstairs. I ate most of my meals there to manage the time better. The breakfast was standard fare. 

The 'deluxe' rooms are almost shaped like a triangle. I thought it was only the room that I was allotted but a glance through some open doors proved otherwise. The rooms are utilitarian but extremely cramped. I love individual beds in general but in this size of room it meant even lesser space to walk around than if you had been in a room with a double bed. 

That being said, the mattresses were nice and I generally slept very comfortably. They don't serve bottled water (good for the environment) but you really have to put a lot of trust in their water filtration. Thankfully, no complaints. 

Room service was generally prompt. 

A very old hotel, but they do their best.

Hotel Comfort inn president was his choice. The hotel is 2 minutes from the airport. The pick up was smooth and hassle free. Rooms are small but packed with all facilities. Corridors carpeted. There is a restaurant that is reasonably good. We ate dinner there. Normal dishes the chef handled well. The sandwiches are very good. Some so called ethnic dishes were not authentic Free WI FI. Complimentary breakfast that was good. The staff are very good, competent and sensitive to your needs. In all, this was a clean cut hotel for ones needs for a short stay.
I needed to check out at evening 5.30 pm where as check out time is 9.00 am. They made a special consideration and allowed me to keep the room without extra cost. I appreciated it. The room tea coffee facility is a boon.
I liked the place. Will stay again if I go. Wish the rooms were little more spacious though.

Rooms are apt, not too large nor cramped. Bathrooms were clean though basic and didn't have fancied fittings. Sleep quality was good as the room was comfortable.
Breakfast spread was reasonable and suited for an Indian business traveller. The hotel was running full occupancy due to the ongoing marriage season.
There are a couple of good restaurants nearby.
For the fitness enthusiasts, there's a large park nearby (abt 1 km) with a jogging track. Morning walk on CG Road is also otherwise fine.
Overall, recommended due to the location.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r254080473-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"412","24429392","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/74/c3/50/praksmumbai.jpg","550","103","106","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PraksMumbai","PraksMumbai","11933B9B4C2B179D9DD141B706CC1F1E",,"294265","Singapore, Singapore","Singapore","PraksMumbai",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

"Nice hotel but location not that good","3","2021-03","2021-05-01","Hotel was neat and clean with spacious room and reception. Housekeeping staff very good. Come for service on a call. It's has 2 inhouse restaurant/rooftop but that is on higher end. Costly on the pocket. It fall on higher end with expensive cuisine. 1 drawback was location which is not very good..u won't find any shops/restaurant/market nearby to eat or roam. Only nearby attraction is agra fort within 2km distance and fort railway station. All location far from this hotel. One has to have his own vehicle or hire auto to go anywher. Parking also a issue as hotel is on highway. Only 3-4cars can be parked infront of hotel.  Strict checkout time..u can keep ur luggage at reception. Staff r professional and polite.

"Noise","1","2020-03","2020-03-19","We stayed here for what should of been 2 nights. 

We booked a taj view room but couldn’t even see the Taj! So just bear that in mind if you book a room with a view. The window in the room would allow all noise in, as the hotel is on a main road you would think they would put some sort of sound proof on the windows. You could hear every car, bird, beep, person. Although being in India this is something you are used too and this wasn’t the actual Issue. The issue we had was that the rooftop bar was playing loud base music until gone 1am. It was awful. We called reception to ask when this music was stopping, they said ‘soon’. 
There was also kids running up and down the stairwell and through the corridor causing so much noise. So with the kids the music and the general traffic noise we couldn’t sleep and decided to leave the hotel at 1.30am in the morning.

Whilst leaving the room we could see the children running up and down the stairs coming from the rooftop bar, so I am assuming their parents were using the bar and restaurant up there. 

We also noticed 2 members of staff walking up and down the stairs who would have been fully aware of how much noise those kids were making. 

Upon leaving the hotel we told the reception staff of our complaints- no apology was given to us. 

Overall I wouldn’t be booking this hotel again and would advise others not too if you like your sleep. 

The only member of staff who we were delighted to see was the man who greeted you by opening the hotel door. We can’t remember his name but he was lovely. Everyone else was rude and not accommodating what so ever.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d6772837-r751443574-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452392144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","1200","1","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisemQ1850NA","Louise M","2AD2142E415BE514691EB74501E26DD5",,,,,"louisemQ1850NA",,"General Manager","759279259","en","2020-07-08","Hotel Alleviate","Dear Valued Guest,

Held a conference here, spent a lot of money and they had construction going on late at night keeping our key speakers awake.  After repeated requests, they stopped banging away for 15 minutes, then resumed into the night until at least 1 AM.  

Had a bad power outage during a reception that ruined the entertainment we paid for to come in.

Carpets had bad stains in them and there was an odor.  Unacceptable conditions.

"Unpleasant stay and experience !!","2","2020-02","2020-02-17","So I checked in on 15th feb 2020, as per my booking welcome drink was included which obviously was not provided, stayed there for about 3 nights. Rooms are nice,spacious and somewhat clean, however the service at the hotel is pathetic. Some of the staff members are courteous and nice.
No toiletries in the bathroom,no restaurant menu card, no laundry bag you just have to handover the clothes without covering then up,only one big towel in the bathroom and no hand towels.(thank god I was carrying my own toiletries and towel).

Service is very slow and take alot of time to get you even a bottle of water and the food is very expensive and not worth the price..

Also some of the switches dont work and there were cockroaches in the bathroom

Overall unpleasant experience would not recommend this place.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d1724243-r745796643-Cambay_Grand_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,,,,,"0","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katariank","Neeta Kataria","156E197F73FAC5C5E897FFE1110FEB1F",,,,,"Katariank",,,,,,,,"Near Perd Centre Sola Over Bridge, Thaltej, Ahmedabad 380054 India","Ahmedabad","India","380054","Gujarat","Near Perd Centre","Sola Over Bridge, Thaltej","1724243","23.05906","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.5228","Cambay Grand Ahmedabad","215","2.9","68","21","39","39","48","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d1724243-Reviews-Cambay_Grand_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.cambayhotels.com/cambay-grand-ahmedabad.htm"

"Please AVOID this hotel.","1","2020-02","2020-02-09","It was the worst hotel we had ever booked. I would request Paytm to immediately stop selling such shady hotels. Their was only staff of 5 people in a hotel of 150 rooms. When we went for check-in on 8th night at 11pm. One of our guest got so offended by the behaviour of the staff at reception and the way he showed us the rooms, dirty shady room. Our guest just left the hotel refusing to stay at such horrifying place. When we asked for our keys for 3 rooms. The guy at reception told us we have only 2 rooms available at present and we cannot give you the third room. Talk to Paytm if you want any refund. Somehow only one of our guest got ready to stay at this hotel and thus finally we occupied only one room.

I am going to sue this hotel for such a behaviour and misconduct. I want my money for 2 rooms immediately refunded. May whatsoever need to be done. I really feel cheated by the hotel and Paytm for selling such a bad hotel giving fake reviews.

Our room key card wasn't working, had to break the door - fix it - wasn't fixed - wait still more for it to be done. All this while we are on vacation and waiting for the hotel to get their act together so that we could go out sightseeing. Restaurant was a joke - without exaggeration, our lunch took 1.5 hrs to get to our table; and that too in instalments. and through all this the attitude of the staff - ""this is how it is.

"Greedy Employees (Read Managers)","1","2014-09","2014-09-25","Hotel is good and rooms are also well maintained. Location is bang on.
Problem starts and ends with employees that too at Manager level.
Booked this hotel for stay on 16-Sep-2014 through www.goibibo.com. Stayed there for not more than 3 hours. Reached at 0700, got ready by 09:30, had breakfast and left. Came for check out at 1330 and did checkout at 1400 hours.
Paid advance to goibibo while booking which included taxes. While checkout manager asked for payment of Rs.350/. Paid the same and asked for receipt. He informed that since booking is through goibibo.com, they will provide invoice.
Even after almost 9 days neither Goibibo nor hotel is providing final invoice and both are pointing fingers at each other.
Choice Hotels being a global brand must employ people who understand I-net bookings and transactions.
Avoid for this reason...","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r230828572-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"412","50277260","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/ff/2b/8c/krisprasad.jpg","550","24","34","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrisPrasad","KrisPrasad","E9F44B117DD938C9E705FCEC228D2A96",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","KrisPrasad",,"Manager","231761295","en","2014-09-30","CIPresident","Dear Sir,

Thank you so much for writing to us with your valuable review.

As informed to you thru email and phone also, your booking was thru goibibo.com they would only provide you with the invoice for the same.  

Please try to understand the channel of booking made, we have billed goibibo.com for your booking and Goibibo.com will bill you and only they can provide you the invoice. 
If you would had directly booked with us we would have given you the invoice. We have asked Goibibo.com to provide an invoice to you.

We do not have any intention to provide any kind of discomfort to you or any of our guests for that matter.

Sir, Our aim is to provide you with high level of comfort at affordable prices.

We look forward for an opportunity to serve you again.

There is one very famous shop named ""Sanskurti"" (for traditional Gujrati dresses, becover, cushion, handbag etc. with reasonable price) only one and half km away from this hotel. Hotel staff are good. Rooms are clean. Food is good. But room is very small , I found room rate and food bills to be costly. We stayed there for two nights on two occasions and we were three in one double bed delux room. We didn't spend day time in hotel, otherwise it would have been problematic for 3 persons to move around in such a small room.

"Comfort Inn - Very comfortable..","4","2013-10","2013-10-27","If you are a business traveler, who expects a comfortable clean place place to stay, this is recommended. The room was octagonal with two long sides. This provided a very comfortable angle to view the TV and a very interesting shape for the bathroom. The bathroom could have have two large angle mirrors near the wash-basin - quite different from usual boring rectangular rooms of a typical business hotel. Lobby was big and had inclined planes like staircases coming down from the upper floors looking down in the lobby, where as lifts were enclosed unlike usual capsule glass lifts. Food was ok. If you have time, it is better to walk down and eat your dinner in some other restaurant..","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r182645726-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"299","453621139","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/09/b5/93/anjoo-n.jpg","299","40","135","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anjoon","Anjoo N","BA551ECCA24CB5F5BE1D3AD4815B2ECC",,,,,"anjoon",,"Manager","182894262","en","2013-10-29","CIPresident","Dear Sir/ Madam,

Since my experiance was not good with the another hotel in ahmedabad.. So i choose this hotel. Overall a comfortable stay. Staff were very helpfull and supportive. They even take care of the guest visited me during my stay. Rooms were clean and bed were comfortable. Room service was fast and prompt and incase of any complain about foods they immediately got that replaced / changed. They got a licenced wine shop as well so incase you wanted to drink you can have it.. i stay there for 4 nights in row and i find it value for money.

"Disappointed ","2","2019-10","2019-10-23","I read the reviews of a couple of reviewers and chose to book this hotel. 

But it was a big disappointment for me. 

Firstly there was no one accompany me till my room.  I had booked a premium room.  The interior seemed to be dirty. The basic extension numbers like, reception, housekeeping, room service etc were no where written. I had to google and get the number of the hotel to reach out for help.
The tv channel subscription was not renewed. The pillow cover was torn, there was no food menu which later I called for. 
The food was the only thing which was good. 

There was no hand towel and floor mat. 

To add more to this, there was no hot water and since I was getting late I had to just manage. 

This was my first and last visit to this hotel.

"Roadside village hotel experience - zero star hotel","1","2019-05","2019-05-31","If you want to experience a roadside village hotel experience in Ahmedabad then choose Cambay Grand. I booked this trip for my family through ClearTrip so that we could have a good experience of staying together. But the series of events that unfolded were worse

1) DIRTY SWIMMING POOL: Two days before I did the booking after calling the hotel and it was confirmed by the manager himself that the swimming pool is ready. But when we went there, there was dust inside the pool like someone has just thrown a garbage truck in the pool with all kinds of litter everywhere. Even the poolside area was full of dirt and it was impossible in every way to sit there. The second thing is the pool can be viewed directly from the nearby residential buildings without offering any privacy of being in a 4-star hotel. It is just like you are bathing in front of all the residents of the building

2) STAFF IS LIAR & GIVE WORST SERVICE - GM of Cambay Grand, Mr. Laxman denied to hear our problems and instead started telling me that if you want to go to a good hotel then you need to pay more. I mean who is he to tell me all this. Moreover, none of the staff came to pick the luggage and guide through the entrance. Terrible!

3) ROOMS WERE DIRTY & BROKEN: We booked 2 rooms for our stay. In one room, shower and AC were broken, the kettle was dirty while in another phone was broken, AC was not swinging air to the room and there was a smell coming out of somewhere. The hotel changed the rooms for us but due to the animosity they held because of our complaints, they did not bring water or towels to our rooms even after calling them thrice. 

So, all in all, I paid the money for the four-star hotel and I received a village hotel kind of service that is available at the fifth price of this hotel.

PLEASE CHECK MY PHOTOS BEFORE BOOKING IT. BOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK.

After this experience, I decided to say NO to CAMBAY group and CLEARTRIP from my future traveling experience","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d1724243-r677834025-Cambay_Grand_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"467","398274645","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/bd/30/55/parasshah27.jpg","467","35","26","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parasshah27","Paras Shah","662581F534F60FC06733E6290A4CD1B2",,"294013","Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Abu Dhabi","parasshah27",,"Manager","679854759","en","2019-06-07","CambayS","Dear Guest,

"DO NOT STAY HERE!
WORST HOTEL IN AHMEDABAD.","1","2019-04","2019-04-01","
Summary:
This is not a 4 star hotel so ignore the ratings online (1 star, if any).
- Cockroaches in the rooms,
- Filthy towels (even with lipstick marks from previous guests as shown in my pictures), dirty bedding and entire room left like a big dustbin,
- Old guest's food left outside rooms on most floors, 
- Heavily rusted bathroom taps, 
- Everything is worn out, smelly and tired looking.

All the pictures shown online appear to be from when the hotel first opened as it looks nothing like it in real life. 

Booking:
We had originally booked for 5 nights but cancelled that as soon as we reached and only ended up staying 1 night due to being too late to find another hotel.

When we reached we thought we would give it the benefit for the doubt, but when shown the rooms we were disgusted.

Hygiene (lack of):
Most pillow covers have stains on them and the pillows themselves are so brown and full of marks that it makes you wonder if they dip them in sewage to ""clean them"".

Yes staff were happy to quickly show us other rooms but even those rooms all had similar issues.
Why have they let such a big hotel get in such a bad state!?

In the end we settled with two alternative rooms which we asked them to fully clean only because we were too tired to complain anymore.
After cleaning, it had a really off damp smell as if they had cleaned it using dirty water, and although we asked for toilet roll (as they had not replaced it) that never arrived.
Furthermore, even after cleaning we were visited by cockroaches! (A very bad sign of hygiene).

We ended up sleeping with our own clothes and towels under and over ourselves as we didn't trust the bedding here.

Reviews:
The replies on all negative reviews from the hotel are mostly all a copy and paste statement so that shows a lack of wanting to improve.

Pictures:
You'll see evidence of most things I've mentioned in my photos. Let's hope the hotel doesn't somehow remove them to hide the facts.

Overall:
Our one night has dampened our experience of Ahmedabad already and I hope no one else has to experience our bad stay at Cambay.

I also worry that there is a lack of bad photos on review sites and so many positive reviews (from new accounts). This could show fake accounts being used to make it sound better than it is.

We left after the one night and booked ""Hotel 440 A Serene Stay"" instead, which yes is a little more expensive, by my gosh it's a hell of a lot better and in a better location! 

Advice:
DO NOT STAY AT CAMBAY AS YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d1724243-r662925756-Cambay_Grand_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"1024","342382255","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/68/56/af/ketan-b.jpg","1024","27","363","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/892ketanb","Ketan B","592A716E8A6B687A16138AF66F2D217D",,"186222","Aylesbury, United Kingdom","Aylesbury","892ketanb",,"Manager","665843741","en","2019-04-12","CambayS","Dear Guest,

The hotel upgraded us to super deluxe room but this was the same with a walk shower, the ac was not working, despite complaints made, Naman the hotel manger refused to do anything.

On departing the room we were asked to pay INR 2551. And when I asked for the receipt I was given one  for INR 315. The hotel manager was not able to explain the difference and told that the bill can be collected from Clear trip.

Holiday inn express is a better hotel at INR 3000.

"Best Avoided","2","2012-12","2012-12-18","I was fairly disappointed by the Comfort inn property.At check in had to sign in a 90s type of big register. Room was dingy and dull. There was no water in the room, and when I asked for water was given water in a big thermos instead of packaged water as is the norm everywhere. Asked the attendant to make my bed, which he did and thyen he heaped the bed cover on top of the almirah which disturbed dirt which was ages old. Evidently no one though of cleaning the top of the almirah. With dust every where I had to ask for the room to be cleaned. Switched on the TV - but as luck would have it the set top box was not working. 

Finally had to get the room changed. Paeprs lying in the corridor, leaking roof top- hotel is just too disappointing. Only saving grace is the location which is bang in the middle of the city.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r147669127-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"205","19820647","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/67/avatar045.jpg","205","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnandR637","Anand R","25E25004F37298C938EA953DECC77DE4",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","AnandR637",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

"Nice place to stay, but below average service","4","2012-11","2012-11-12","Good, spacious clean, decent rooms with all the amenities required of a the star hotel. Superb location, right across CG rd, which is a prime shopping destination. Overall a pleasant place to stay. But two negatives- firstly, the room service is below average. To cite an example, we stayed there for two days with my family, & on the second day, since my toothbrush accidently fell into toilet comode, when I requested for a toothbrush, I was rudely told, ""dental kit is provided only once during the entire stay""! ! ! ! Similar story with the restaurant. Firstly, they don't provide buffet breakfast. Only one or two dishes are available to choose from- either aaloo paratha or poha. And the attendants behave as if they're obliging us by serving us! But barring these ""overlookable"" things, overall a decent experience.

The airport pick up isnt just for you. They have shuttle service and dont serve you. So please arrange your own if thats not OK. I arranged for my own it was Rs.600! The room was tiny for a deluxe room. Two of us stayed and we were cramped. The washroom was also the same. The room shape was really odd. More of a diamond shape. The bed was comfy to sleep. The location was great. You have good malls nearby too. The morning breakfast was nice. It had variety. I had loads of issue with wifi. Of the 6 days only 2 days I was given their free wifi. On asking for password, I was not given.

Another issue was at checkout. I had informed the before evening that I had to catch early flight and so requested them to keep my bills ready. The morning, they person there lost my advance receipt! On check in I used my card to pay advance. The person didnt find his copy. I had to open my laptop, login to my account, show him my receipt that I downloaded and even MAILED HIM!

"Decent 3 star hotel .","4","2023-01","2023-02-19","We stayed in the hotel on 14th Jan and 15th Jan 2023. The hotel is near to Taj mahal and Agra fort. Accommodation was decent for a budget hotel and the room service and restaurant was good. Dev and Mohanlal did good room service.  hot water facility was good for the cold weather. Hot drinking water was provided whenever we asked the reception. Overall it was a good stay for a budget hotel.

Some of the people did late night check in and so there was noise outside the corridor. subsided after midnight. Lift could be extended till the last 5th floor where dining/ restaurant was available. Lift facility was up to 4th floor. Never the less room service was available.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d2038421-r879383890-Hotel_Taj_Inn-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452389216","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harularasu","Arularasu","FC38286DA80D92D92056A4D4B7622E55",,,,,"harularasu",,"General Manager","881009746","en","2023-03-04","Mohit Maheshwari","Dear Guest, What an immense pleasure to read your review !

"Worst experience in terms of transport provided, and trip planning around agra","1","2022-12","2022-12-19","The hotel is average and a bit overpriced when it comes to food, hospitality is ok but please never plan through the hotel any agra or nearby tours. The driver they provide will not listen to you at all, will take you to his desired places of eateries while you are traveling with them ( the eateries have terrible food, too much oily too much spicy) and when you try to tell them to take you to some place like mall in agra for example, then will throw tantrums and show anger. Not at all good way to address any tourists. Pretty bad experience, and I would suggest you to take your own vehicle and make plans if you are from nearby Agra rather than using their transport provided via hotel. Too much overpriced and better use government hotels and their provided guides specially at fatehpur sikri as the guides literally make holes in your pocket and show nothing that worths the huge amount of ₹1140 . Totally literal thieves.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d2038421-r872212051-Hotel_Taj_Inn-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452388731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trail55839844165","pronoy","BB7118E05D3C784787B850442AE5EF19",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Trail55839844165",,"General Manager","881009926","en","2023-03-04","Mohit Maheshwari","Dear Guest, Thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to write this feedback.

"Bad hotel with Good location","2","2022-10","2022-11-27","One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed. Staffs, manager don’t care about guests, argue unnecessarily with their funny policies very rudely. Staffs demand tip separately for every services. We had to pay tips three times for carrying our luggage. They do this demand in front of management persons which means management doesn’t have any control or have share with them. 
During checkout they overbilled us and didn’t want to provide the bill before paying. After asking for breakup, we could only come to know that they are adding room amount which we paid fully during check-in. Then they reduced the bill but never told us a single apology word.
Food was overpriced and very bad in taste. Buffet breakfast also had very limited options compare to the price. All bathroom fittings were not working properly too. Room had no window.
There was some renovation work going on just in front of our room continuously during our stay. We had to bear loud machine noise, staffs’ loud screaming just in front of our door, though there were many same categories’ empty rooms were there.
Only good thing is the location to the Taj mahal. Just 10 mins walking distance away from the Western gate. If you want to visit early morning during sunrise, this location is perfect to stay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d2038421-r869884946-Hotel_Taj_Inn-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"452","108680878","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/7a/56/ae/smboser.jpg","379","42","116","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smboser","Subhramalya B","8FCD33C57471FF2AEF8C5E4A6BA36B75",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","smboser",,"General Manager","881009946","en","2023-03-04","Mohit Maheshwari","Dear Guest, Thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to write this feedback.

The area outside the hotel seemed to be a bit cleaner and kept up more than most areas of town since the large tourists hotels were in this area . The hotel is beautiful and the rooms were very nice, clean and spacious. The front desk staff were very professional and helpful. The hotel has a very nice rooftop bar great in the evenings for drinks and appetizers.The breakfast buffet was very large and had adequate offerings of Indian and Western type food. It was always busy but didn't seem crowded and seemed to have a number of tour groups which is normally a sign that the hotel is a good place to stay for tourists and family.....

"Very bad Experience","1","2019-11","2019-11-27","We visited Agra with family for 3 days and booked this hotel for 3 adults and was promised that extra bed will good enough. 
We reached at hotel at around 1030AM and hotel guys took time to find the booking and asked us to wait till 1130AM  and they don’t know what was booked. First they showed us room which was so congested and had smell of smoking. Asked hem to change room with good lighting and space. Then they took us in other which was ok and asked them to give us good extra bed but to our surprise the bed was so bad but somehow we adjusted as we were tired after long travel. 
We were sleeping at night and suddenly at around 0030hrs at midnight the hotel staff opens our room to show to foreign national and enters in room and suddenly realises that it’s occupied, says sorry and goes out.
Since we were sleeping and my son who was on extra bed wakes up and couldn’t see the face of person. 
To our surprise this employee doesn’t informs at reception about his mistake. In the morning my son informs me and while going for breakfast we check at reception. To our surprise they were blank to know this. Reception starts calling the persons on duty but no one agrees to accept his mistake. 
To me it’s a worst  mistake of reception because reception knows which room is occupied. They usually guide their staff to take their staff to show the rooms. 
In the morning hotel staff comes to our room and feels sorry but our concern was why such mistake has happened. 
It’s your privacy and customer has paid for room so no one should enter even by mistake.
We checked out next day as our stay was for another night.
We didn’t created any scene but felt very bad.
The lighting at bathroom is too less can’t see properly. 
Our overall experience with this hotel is BAD. 
I have put pic of bathroom lighting and extra bed I was talking about. 
Please be aware.

The rooms have no window and the wall are like a bit watery and it's like a tropical environment in which there are a lot of bacteria (we all got sick the next day). The bed and the quilt were also like moist and I asked for them to change. The room service guys changed but it was in the same condition again.
We were having suffocation in the room and it was a sick kinda environment.

Positives were: room service was good, the Looby area was nice.

and the cost of the breakfast was not deducted from the bill
The hotel staff were kind enough to tell us why they gave us the room with no windows and on the 2nd floor. The noise from the rooftop night club is very disturbing and goes on all night.

It was pleasure to have you for 18 nights as our Guest. We are sorry for occasional issues faced by you. We looked in to the matter and found that that you booked a deluxe category room for your stay which you didn’t liked and thus you were upgraded to our suite category room in two days of your stay to provide you a memorable stay experience. The Suite room with all amenities was liked by you and you expressed your happiness with the upgrade. Post upgrade we never heard about any housekeeping related issue from your end during your stay. Housekeeping is carried out as per Hotel Industry Standards and on occasions when guests decline for the service, their decision is respected. The hot water issue was attended immediately upon being communicated and rectified. 

We respect our Guest’s feedback which helps us in continuously improving ourselves. 

Thank you so much.","Near Perd Centre Sola Over Bridge, Thaltej, Ahmedabad 380054 India","Ahmedabad","India","380054","Gujarat","Near Perd Centre","Sola Over Bridge, Thaltej","1724243","23.05906","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.5228","Cambay Grand Ahmedabad","215","2.9","68","21","39","39","48","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d1724243-Reviews-Cambay_Grand_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.cambayhotels.com/cambay-grand-ahmedabad.htm"

"Do not recommend for value","2","2018-12","2019-01-08","i am a little disappointed at this hotel since it has potential but does not live up to it. i stayed in Dec in this place and made a booking through Hotels.com. the room we were given had a window that wouldnt close without help and showers that were leaking. after complaining the response was quick but the floor was dirtied by the workers who helped repair and no indication to clean it afterward. i complained the next day and got it cleaned anyway. The rooms are overpriced and so is the food. More importantly it was difficult for us to assess the quality of hygiene at this place. People seemed nice but the management looks shabby.  certainly not a recommend unless you get one star rates and are a bachelor who doesn't care about cleanliness and quality of room.

The hotel was improving since a year as it was worse earlier but now it's really worst.

All the rooms have small cockroaches and the hotel do sent do any pest control. Just soap, body wash, shampoo in the bathroom. Towel is fine. Beds are ok, front desk staff is very uncooperative.

"Worth Staying !!","4","2012-05","2012-06-01","I was on a business trip and stayed here for 4 nights. The hotel has got everything that a mid size budget hotel can offer but there are certain things which needs urgent attention. First i would like to appreciate the complimentary airport pick up and drop which is rare for budget hotels and that too in brand new Toyota. The deluxe rooms need major renovation and so does the corridor on the deluxe floor as the carpet smells very bad. The super deluxe rooms are however quite better but the bathrooms is designed in way that if you take a shower you end  with water all over the bathroom area as they have no cubical. The room service staff is quite unprofessional as they hardly know whats on the menu but the food was nice. The breakfast is a big disaster as they hardly have two variety which includes a south Indian dish and paratha however eggs are served from the kitchen. Don't expect a view from your room and stay here only if you don't have to spend much time in the room.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r131062441-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"50","139064410","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/49/f4/5a/pankaj15.jpg","50","27","39","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pankaj15","Pankaj15","4BC466AC3609149128E700403A04ED77",,"32655","Los Angeles, California","Los Angeles","Pankaj15",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

"Poor service, rood manager, very small rooms...totalling to mess of your trip","2","2012-02","2012-05-04","1.Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights (10 & 11 Feb 2012)
2.Hotel is rated 3 star status but from any angle it is not equal to even a single star.
3.Very small & veard shaped rooms (trangles n pantagon shapes). It takes time to adjust with the room. No effort for interior beautification.
4.View from window is of dirty terrace...which add to your negativity about the room.
5.This is the first and only 3 star hotel I have ever seen who don't offer one complimentary mineral water bottle a day.
6.We needed to ask thrice for towels. Bath tub was leak and threr were cracks in it.
7.Hotel charge you MAP plan but they don't have bufe at dinner time and management ask you to select from menu.....and confuse you about whether it is under MAP plan or charged sepaartely. Quality of the food is OK but nothing special.
8.Hotel offer airport pick-up service but wait a guest for other guest reching from another flight. It is hard to wait for a hour at the aitport with luggage to full the occupancy capacity of the vehicle. 
9.It is at all not a value for money we paid.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r129387194-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"412","37172724","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/37/35/f4/manjiri-kush.jpg","550","2","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manjiri_Kush","Manjiri_Kush","3DC6D76D9E5516198437E795DB5C4A8C",,,,,"Manjiri_Kush",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

Best of all. when we were pressed for time, they took charge of a parcel of unwanted luggage and faithfully despatched it to Australia for us.

Room service and cleaning was prompt and efficient. In short all that we heard about India, we experienced in ten folds.

"""Not Advisable - Apathetic Service""","1","2011-10","2011-11-04","Being centrally located (off CG road), this hotel has a location advantage. The room size was appropriate and was clean. But the hotel falls short on multiple service aspects.  Certain basic expected things were also not ensured to be kept in place. Even the drinking water in the room was not refilled at the time of check-in or regularly (once a day) during the stay. I had to call up room service everyday to ask them to refill.  The hotel's website boasts of a fitness centre. The fitness centre had a threadmill and an exercise bike, but apart from which there was hardly any space for more than one person to do any exercise. Both the threadmill and an exercise bike were not in a functioning condition during both the days I stayed there. When asked about it the manager was totally apathetic. The restaurant had a good variety of food. Though the taste of items was good, the service again was pathetic. A small cockroach was spotted on the table during the dinner. When the manager was told about it, he did not even try to apologise. Overall, I would not advise this place except it is for just one night stay and if location is closer.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r120148614-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"50","227770666","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/93/81/2a/m-yugi.jpg","50","1","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/677yugandharm","yugandhar m","0669248A6EE43F8261DA59CD6703D006",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","677yugandharm",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

"Good value for money!","3","2011-10","2011-10-02","This hotel offers good value for money and is located in the heart of the city (CG Road). The rooms are slightly small and odd in shape (shaped like a pentagon) but you get used to it in sometime.

The Zaffran restaurant is good and offers a decent variety of indian and continental food. Food quality is very good. The complimentary breakfast quality can be improved though.

The hotel does not have a good fitness centre and hence i had to venture out for my morning jog. Luckily, there is a park nearby called Law Garden (1km away) which is frequented by all fitness enthusiasts and the energetic feel of the place is great.

The place is very well connected and autorickshaws are available at all times of the day.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r118850186-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"450","33133128","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f9/92/48/krishnadorai.jpg","359","58","120","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krishnadorai","krishnadorai","5A15B31EFA4855086CFDF4F2C9914113",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","krishnadorai",,"C.O.O","119208094","en","2011-10-11","cometo_president","Dear Guest,

Interestingly enough I was guided by one of my friends about hotel alleviate near the banks of Yamuna.  It was fabulous . The nice cosy rooms ...the excellent location ...the warmth of reception...the queer friendly staff...the roof top bar and disco...and the splendid view of the Taj from rooftop ....trulymade my Agra tour the most memorable one. I sincerely like to thank all the boys of housekeeping; the men at buffet and cafeteria and Mr Hemant  atthe reception who made me so comfortable.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d6772837-r677262603-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452390812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg","1200","5","43","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samrat2014dutta","SAMRAT D","0BDCA52000E5C099CD0948BDFD29CEAF",,,,,"samrat2014dutta",,"General Manager","679397221","en","2019-06-06","DARAB_KHAN","Dear Guest,

"Not a hotel, a night club! Do not stay here!!","1","2019-05","2019-05-27","Came to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal at Sunset on Sunday morning. From 10/11pm all we could hear and feel was the bass from a nightclub on the 4th floor (our room was on the 2nd). Knowing we were getting up at 4am, we complained and told it should finish at 2am. They offered a room on the 1st floor, but it was still loud. We were not told when we checked-in and was not on their website, despite it appearing to be a regular thing. It didn't stop until 3am, leaving us 1 hour of sleep. 
Prior to the club starting, at 9pm we were told the 4th floor bar was closed. It obviously wasn't and we got the impression from previous reviewers that this hasn't been the first time either, and so think it's only for locals only.

We tried to complain to the Manager at 7am and were told to wait 30mins. At 7:45 we tried again and told to wait 30mins. At 9am when we wanted to check-out, he arrived 15mins later after us threatening to leave. He was very rude and was clearly did not want to have to deal with us, walking away multiple times. They were happy to give us a 15% discount, but we did not feel this reasonable and called the Tourist Police. They were very helpful and helped us get the room to a reasonable price.

I don't know if this happens every night, but DO NOT stay here on a Saturday night. The manager cares more about his night club than his guests. If you have any issues though, give the Tourist Police a call- they're there to help in such situations.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d6772837-r676854513-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"350","397434508","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/b0/5e/8c/suzie-p.jpg","350","2","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/372suziep","Suzie P","A07381DF7F71AD1C5E3536A42FD99A06",,,,,"372suziep",,,,,,,,"6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road, Agra 282003 India","Agra","India","282003","Uttar Pradesh","6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road",,"6772837","27.19004","Agra, Agra District, Uttar Pradesh","78.024895","Hotel Alleviate","363","3.9","39","18","53","92","161","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297683-d6772837-Reviews-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html","http://www.hotelalleviate.com"
"ABSOLUTELY STAY AWAY, this is no Hotel, it is a night club ","1","2019-04","2019-04-27","I stayed at the hotel 27 to 29 April, on top floor there is a really nice rooftop restaurant and bar and techno club, serving really nice food but far from local price. Every night on top floor, play loud music from 9pm until 3 to 4 am in the morning, we arrived in the weekend so the music was unbearable. They said they put us on third floor with view to the Taj and we were excited...but what comes at 9pm shocked us...from around midnight all the indien guests or other from outside went up for party...jumping horribly we can hear in our room so clear...the lamp on the sealing shaking .... I complained twice to the poor receptionist but nothing he can do as rooms were fully booked and it is management desire to run hotel this way. This hotel is not a place to sleep because you will not be able to, if there isn’t party in the basement, there is party on the top floor every night. Receptionist told us that music will stop at 2am but 3am went and still boom boom boom in our room. We plan to go to Taj Mahal in the morning, this option wont be possible if you stay here. Room is ok for the price, bathroom but no hot water in the bathroom. We have no problem with air conditioner. We requested 2 single bed and paid for larger room but got 1 double bed for 2 boys so they have to bring extra bed for my mate to sleep. Pay a little more and get a better hotel, this establishment does not runs a hotel, they run night clubs and party.  Final word, if you come for restaurant and rooftop clubbing, this is the place..it has really modern restaurant and club but if you are here to sleep and rest...you will not get to that.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d6772837-r669714973-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452390771","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZJensen","ZJensen","F17DBD8C1C8165C8B8BFA3CC562DE308",,,,,"ZJensen",,,,,,,,"6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road, Agra 282003 India","Agra","India","282003","Uttar Pradesh","6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road",,"6772837","27.19004","Agra, Agra District, Uttar Pradesh","78.024895","Hotel Alleviate","363","3.9","39","18","53","92","161","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297683-d6772837-Reviews-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html","http://www.hotelalleviate.com"

However, the only thing that disappointed was perhaps staff help. We left something in the room and tried to contact them to no avail. The staff were not nearly as attentive and helpful as everywhere else we travelled in india. 
I'd say this hotel is ok but could potentially disappoint. Although food was good to be fair.

"Bad Experience","1","2019-02","2019-02-12","The staff was rude and not customer friendly. We complained about some strange noise in the room during the night. They did change the room on our request but the noise continued for the 2nd night in succession which left us sleepless and irrate. 

We asked for toiletries but never got them on time.

The hotel doesn't seem to care much about it's customer's comfort and their attitude reeks of mediocrity.

Definitely not visiting this hotel again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d6772837-r651735224-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,,,,,"0","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revanthb2017","Revanth B","43E8F183A534C0822CC89AB9CF247DA3",,,,,"revanthb2017",,,,,,,,"6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road, Agra 282003 India","Agra","India","282003","Uttar Pradesh","6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road",,"6772837","27.19004","Agra, Agra District, Uttar Pradesh","78.024895","Hotel Alleviate","363","3.9","39","18","53","92","161","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297683-d6772837-Reviews-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html","http://www.hotelalleviate.com"

"Attention aux arnaques !","2","2019-02","2019-02-03","Nous avons dormi à cet hôtel la nuit dernière, nous étions charmés par la propreté de la chambre et le roovtop jusqu a se que nous remarquions que nous nous faisions arnaquer..
Tout d’abord 
nous avons booker une chambre à 30 euros 40 et arrivés à l hôtel on a du payé 36euros60 soit environ 20 % de taxe en plus c’est inadmissible en Inde.. nous avions réservé une chambre à deux lits simples et baignoire et on nous a donné un seul lit double et une douche. 
Ensuite comme il est proposé sur le site nous voulions aller au spa, à l’accueil ils ont été incapable de nous dire ou nous pourrions trouver un spa. Il ne savait même pas nous montrer où nous étions situé sur la carte..
Nous voulions prendre un bus pour allé visiter un fort à environ 1heure de la ville et ils nous ont dit qu il n y avait pas de bus mais que des taxi, en nous proposant un taxi à 3000 roupi, wawe! Au final il y a des bus pour y aller à 45 roupi.. et les taxi ne demandaient que 1400 roupi. Et ils nous ont refait le coup en nous disant qu il n y avait pas de bus pour aller à Jaipour et qu ils pouvaient nous trouver un taxi.. je pense qu ils ont des commissions sur les taxi et abusent sur les prix et mentent sur les autres moyens de transports..
Et ce n est pas fini, méfiez vous du personnel de l’accueil, nous avons du réclamer après avoir payé qu il nous rende la monnaie.. même si ce n’était que 50roupi c’est inimaginable dans un hôtel. 
Pour finir nous avons demandé un service pressing, ils n ont pas été capable de nous annoncer un prix, nous avons donné environ 15pieces de linge (tee shirt, pantalon fin, etc..) et des chaussettes et sous vêtements et la facture a été de 1109 roupi! 16euros de pressing ! Alors qu a Varanasi c était 6 roupi pour les grosses pièces.. un scandale.. au moment de payer nous avons donné 1500 roupi, nous étions agacés et quand nous avons rangé notre monnaie nous nous sommes rendus compte qu’il ne nous avait rendu que 300 roupi..
Nous sommes très déçu car l hôtel est joli mais le personnel est incapable et il faut même s en méfier..","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d6772837-r649880034-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","18","38","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lantiboise06600","Lantiboise06600","8228B7B7CF488F42D40090221B0D7AA1",,,,,"Lantiboise06600",,,,,,,,"6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road, Agra 282003 India","Agra","India","282003","Uttar Pradesh","6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road",,"6772837","27.19004","Agra, Agra District, Uttar Pradesh","78.024895","Hotel Alleviate","363","3.9","39","18","53","92","161","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297683-d6772837-Reviews-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html","http://www.hotelalleviate.com"

Location was alright considering it is very close to the Taj and the Fort. The only we issue we had was the rooms. It was a very small room with no window hence you can't stay for long inside the room as it starts to get depressing and suffocating. As per the info provided to us by hotel staff, all the Deluxe rooms are like this.
If you ever stay in this hotel, you should book the rooms with a view. Deluxe rooms are certainly not recommended.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d6772837-r647301476-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"50","109722468","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/8a/3b/64/siddharth-s.jpg","50","12","28","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SIDDHARTHS1184","Siddharth Siddharth","A8E5FF75DABC41639B052D98E4616D42",,"294265","Singapore, Singapore","Singapore","SIDDHARTHS1184",,,,,,,,"6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road, Agra 282003 India","Agra","India","282003","Uttar Pradesh","6/27/1A Yamuna Kinara Road",,"6772837","27.19004","Agra, Agra District, Uttar Pradesh","78.024895","Hotel Alleviate","363","3.9","39","18","53","92","161","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297683-d6772837-Reviews-Hotel_Alleviate-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html","http://www.hotelalleviate.com"

"New Year’s Eve stay ","4","2019-01","2019-01-15","We booked this hotel for 6 people in the New Year’s Eve. 

The staff was a really friendly, properly English speakers and helpful(they even gave us a recommendations were to celebrate NYE). They have a beautiful rooftop, but it’s cold in this season. They had a party that day and then we asked about the price, they were lying that there is “no space, they going to do some space for us, but the price will be for the entrence 5000 rps per person.” Of course we found a beautiful place for us in other restaurant but In the end there was lots of free space in our rooftop restaurant... 

Rooms were clean, with hot water, a/c and safe. 

I wasn’t happy about the showers, because it wasn’t that clean and comfortable (it was really tiny and the shower is so close to toilet, it’s even hard to move) but my all family members rate this hotel to 5. 

So we definitely recommend you to stay here!

La ducha cerrada con vidrio (NO inundando como en otros hoteles), buenos artículos de higiene, secadora de pelo, espejo de aumento, muy cómodo. 

El mayor inconveniente es que hay un restaurant-bar-disco en la azotea y es un edificio bajo, de unos 4 pisos … Nos explicaron con mucho orgullo que es el lugar más famoso de la ciudad, había un gentío y la música atronó durante varias horas sobre nuestras cabezas … Era lo último que buscábamos para las poquitas horas disponibles de descanso, ya que llegamos de nochecita y es preciso levantarse de madrugada para ingresar al Taj Mahal. 

El restaurant de planta baja es muy bueno pero en la mañana casi ayunamos porque los tours visitan el Taj, luego traen de regreso a desayunar, y el hotel tiene horario inamovible de 7:30 a 10:30 am. Apenas llegamos a lo que quedaba.

"Incredibly Average Stay","3","2019-03","2019-03-14","Overall experience of the hotel was fine, but a couple of things  didn't work.

Positives- Location is a huge plus point, food is good, room service is quick

Negatives- Basic amenities like 'Toothpaste/Dental kit' and 'Hand wash' near wash basin were missing. One doesn't expect to ask for these things when paying anything above 4k for ome night in a tier 2 city. Also, visitor policy doesn't allow any guest after 9 PM, which is too early.
Construction is quite old, and it reflects in walls and furniture quality. 

Overall, the experience was quite average.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d299355-r658486571-Comfort_Inn_Sunset-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"50","365464194","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/c8/8a/82/abhishek-t.jpg","50","2","32","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbhishekTyagi77","AbhishekTyagi77","2587736770064882784052BB8D865153",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","AbhishekTyagi77",,"Manager","658738200","en","2019-03-15","ghanshyamgoplani","Dear Sir / Madam,

Für indische Verhältnisse ist das Hotel in Ordnung. Nach deutschem Maßstab untere Klasse. 

Das Frühstück ist eine kleine Katastrophe. Ich habe lediglich ein Toast mit Marmalade gefrühstückt. Das Zimmer war sauber und ordentlich. 

Beim CheckOut wurde zuerst ein falscher Preis berechnet. Erst nach einer viertel Stunde und meiner Hartnäckigkeit wurde der vereinbarte Preis abgerechnet. 

Eine Rikhsa wurde bestellt und kam nicht (wahrscheinlich nie bestellt) und ein Hotelangestellter hat uns dann gefahren. Ein Preis und Hin/Rückfahrt wurde vereinbart und dann aber nicht eingehalten. Wie so oft in Indien: Abzocke.

The cleanliness of the Bed and the toilet. In this case, it was like ""WoW"".

The Room service is a bit expensive, but nevertheless, it tastes so good and also the quantity is sumptuous. With one Fried rice or noodles, two people can comfortable have dinner.

It is in the heart of the city from where most of the places are easy to access. There are chat shops when we come out few meters outside, good joints for shopping, market etc. The service while moving in the hotel also is good.

I also was surprised to see the kits in the hotel. They even have a shoe polish, business kit, medical kit apart from the normal soaps and shampoos.

Overall, they make you comfortable and will make you come back","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r115823230-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"450","32692957","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f2/da/dd/itsvenky.jpg","493","4","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsvenky","Venkatesh S","FAD48DEE4EB778470657E0087E6453B7",,,,,"itsvenky",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

Rooms are small yet nicely decorated and furnished for comfort.

Observed that the room service staff was lousy

Staff member who escorted me to my room was accompanied by one more staff (most probably a fresher/trainee), he was more keen on training the new-joinee than briefing me on facilities available in the room despite all this was expecting tip for this service.

Also told me that instead of ordering the food to my room, I shall go downstairs for dinner and enjoy the restaurant which is recently modified & re-decorated. (may be he want me to place an order and bother the room service person for dinner)

Next day while check out, my food bill were not availble at the reception, receptionist called up room service to get the same and made me wait for another 20-25 mins.

"Well located, value for money, good service","3","2011-02","2011-05-01","I was recommended this hotel, as I traversed Ahmedabad one night in utter frustation looking for a night's accommodation. I believe the wedding season was on, and most hotels that I knew and was comfortable to try checking in, politely declined a walk-in. 

After about four tries, I arrived at this hotel, which not only offered by an immediate Deluxe Room, at a very competitive tariff, but the prosepct of room service at midnight!

The ""Pizza"" they served up was the ""Gujarati"" version I guess with some liberal sprinkling of tomato ketchup.... but it did help to get a bite after some tiring travel that included a delayed layover at Mumbai Airport.

The Room was large, clean and comofrtable, but did not accord any view - inly a sliver of a window for some sunlight when I woke up in the morning. All in all, the location is very central for folks with business on the Western half of Ahmedabad - and the service very prompt and present.

"Great Stay , better than other 5 stars in the city ..!","5","2011-03","2011-04-02","I visited Ahmedabad from Los Angeles for India Australia world cup cricket game and booked my stay at Comfort Inn President. The moment I entered the lobby I was impressed by the grandness of it. I have stayed at few other 5 stars in the city before but all of them are cramped and me being claustrophobic did not appreciate that.

The room was very spacious and had a separate sitting area(almost like a mini living room) for breakfast. I needed Wifi and concierge provided me the details and the wifi connection was fast. 

All in all my stay for very satisfactory , however I must add something about their food without which my review would not be complete. I LOVED the food here.

Butter Chicken Boneless , Drums of Heaven and Masala Khichdi were mouth watering and in fact I would return here someday only to have an opportunity to dine again at this hotel.

"Choose this hotel only for its central location","3","2010-12","2010-12-14","Obviously, the establishment has seen better days and now past its prime.The location,just off the C.G. Road, is the the only reason to choose this hotel.
The deluxe room, the cheapest, is very small and this is not Mumbai.For what you get,it is pricey too.
If size is not an issue it is otherwise comfortably furnished and everytrhing in the toilet also works satisfactorily.
The onsite restaurant is decent.You are,ofcourse,not going to remember what you ate for a long time.
Had a bad experience while checking out.I went to the hotel as my club was full and asked them for the cheapest room.The executive at the counter said that I should pay the entire rental in advance which I did.Yet at the time of checking out, they did try to extract extra money from me saying that the man at the reception at the time of check in was wrong.It was a bitter parting and entirely avoidable.
Though the hotel brouchre says that breakfast,which is included in tariff, is available from 7 A.M. onwards,we didn't get any till 8 A.M. and left having bread and jam and coffee.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297608-d574436-r89821756-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",,"205","19820681","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/89/avatar010.jpg","205","30","85","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohantymr","mohantymr","6493CF7DB7985FA227DC2DAFB0BC0815",,"293860","India","India","mohantymr",,,,,,,,"Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market, Ahmedabad 380009 India","Ahmedabad","India","380009","Gujarat","Off C.G.Road Opposite Municipal Market","","574436","23.03434","Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad District, Gujarat","72.56145","Comfort Inn President","149","3.6","9","15","33","58","34","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297608-d574436-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_President-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html","http://www.comfortinnpresident.com/"

"Overall Average experience but professional front desk manager","3","2022-10","2022-10-10","We stayed in this hotel only for a day (not night). The rooms had a musty smell. The service. The Manager, Mohit, was extremely professional and made sure he called us multiple times before arrival. He helped with booking the cab for station pick up and arranging for a guide to visit Taj. The guide (Mohammed) was a very resourceful and knowledgeable person. Buffet breakfast was an ok spread. Not great. 

One big concern with the staff (security and bearers) is that they were constantly expecting tips right from carrying the bags to the room, to delivering tea and loading bags to the car. It felt intimidating. 

The room and hotel pics posted in tripadvisor show the place as brand new and sparkling. This was not the case.

- It is actually like an ordinary local lodge!
- We could not find at least one properly trained hotel Staff 
- Most of them were staring at the girls in our group. We felt very uncomfortable.
- Rooms were too small with dust 
- Bedsheet had stains, beds were too old
- Stinking toilet with unclean closet and without any Exhaust or window!
- Toiletries were age old. We got broken soaps and discolored towels etc
- Nothing for coffee/tea making, not even a kettle.
- Room had no windows or air holes!
- We had to pay money for early check in (for 1.5 hours)
- Its a very old, poorly maintained property
- Hot water was not available in the night(though we requested)
- Switches were not working 
- Last but not least, There was a STRONG NEGATIVE VIBE inside the room.

"Staff was the best in India! Clean rooms","5","2019-10","2020-01-21","We traveled around northern India for almost 4 weeks and kept talking about how no hotel staff could compare to that of the Taj View - especially the restaurant and cleaning staff (front desk staff were not nice). 

The restaurant staff went out of their way to be kind, helpful, and teach us about India foods. I cried when we left because I was sad about leaving people who felt like friends! The cleaning staff too were so kind and attentive and gave us wonderful towel flowers (more elaborate by the day)! 

The front desk staff were almost the complete opposite and not very welcoming or kind, unfortunately, but all restaurant staff (day and night) + the manager, cleaning staff, and door/security staff were amazing. 

Our hotel room was an older version but it was still clean and felt like we were traveling! 

Thank you, thank you to the amazing restaurant, security/door, and cleaning staff at Taj View -you truly made our time in Agra and all of India so wonderful.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297683-d2038421-r740512670-Hotel_Taj_Inn-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452391125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg","1200","60","86","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingbugs8","travelingbugs8","A2C97F7689F6C559E187F15DB250D748",,,,,"travelingbugs8",,"General Manager","833149814","en","2022-04-02","Padam Chaudhary","Thank you for taking the time to review our property, your comments are very much valued.
