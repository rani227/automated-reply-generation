"Extremely poor condition. Please read complete review","1","2024-12","2025-01-05","The location of this hotel is excellent, but the maintenance and hygiene standards are extremely poor. I’ve been staying here for the past 10 years, but in the last 2 years, the quality has declined drastically. 
Don't rely on reviews older than two years, as the condition was much better back then. However, the management now seems to have completely left the hotel in the hands of the staff, and as you can imagine, how they will take care without any supervision. 
We stayed in the soo called most premium AC rooms of the hotel. they reuse dustbin bags from previous stays, which still have stains of tobacco and ketchup. The towels were dirtyyy, and the bed sheets appeared to have not been changed since the last 2-3 guests. The sofa and chairs were also in poor condition. There was noticeable seepage on the walls throughout the room, and a foul odor lingered in the air.

We had booked the room for two days, but the conditions were so bad that we considered switching hotels the following day (although we couldn't, every hotel was full because of new year). Despite the hotel being nearly empty, both the room service and cleanliness were abysmal, and the overall service was disappointing.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r987878572-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452390812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAir02916520466","OnAir02916520466","034AE6D75B1446477D65F1850B626F53",,,,,"OnAir02916520466",,,,,,,,"The Mall Rd Opp Ropeways, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","The Mall Rd","Opp Ropeways","1156304","30.457487","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.07549","Hotel Mall Palace","204","3.7","20","10","32","86","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d1156304-Reviews-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","https://www.facebook.com/hotelmallpalace.in/"

"Excellent hotel in mall road","5","2024-01","2024-01-08","Hotel is located at mall road near roap way.
I stayed in this hotel in Jan 2024 with my family , Very good experience about Hotel location , scenic view from balcony , rooms , staff services & food .

However I want to share an incident that happened to me in that hotel.
My daughter's health suddenly worsened at night around 4 am , I connected to the reception , One staff Manish was there , He immediately called his other staff Pooran , 
Even though so cold in the morning at around 5 am  , Pooran took me to the doctor on two wheeler for my daughter . 
Really I salute to Pooran from my heart who helped me so much that night  , may god give him much progress in life.

However All other staffs were also very polite, well-behaved & knows how to handle their customer

Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for great place to stay in Mussoorie.

"WORST HOTEL","1","2023-08","2023-08-16","""NEVER GO FOR THIS PROPERTY ""
Hotel rooms just look good in pictures , the bedsheets have leftover hairs on them and no cleaning done even after 2-3 requests. 
Washrooms are too smelly and even their furniture is old and broken
The worst experience ever had in any hotel visited. 
Hotel staff is so arrogant and rude ,
ZERO hospitality, Even the owner himself is so rude that he doesn't listen to any of your problems. 
Don't get fooled by believing that this hotel is on mall road 
Walkablity of the hotel from the library chowk is around 1.5km (rickshaw cost-250) . 
Guests have to climb around 40-50 stairs to reach the hotel so it is very difficult for the old age citizens to get there.
Hotel staff also Didn't came to pick up our luggage.
A wise person would never go for this hotel.

"Good hotel, excellent location.... but POOR service","3","2023-08","2023-08-13","Hotel is good. Location is excellent. But service is below par. As I write, I'm still at #103 . I would point few things out.

1) The room is just beside the entrance stair. Hence, you cannot remove the curtains because of your privacy

2) Right after check-in I informed the Front Desk that the intercom in my room was not working. Not for once in last 2 days, anyone bothered to come & check. 

3) You provide tea/ coffee amenities in room which is excellent. But again no suger / suger fee sachets were provided. I had to tell Front Desk yesterday. After that only I got some. 

Being a hotelier myself, these 3 basic errors are not acceptable to me. I've got a feeling that I faced these issues since my reservation was from an online portal ( lesser tariff than the Hotel Tariff quoted to me by mail)

I'll perhaps book another hotel next time I visit Mussoorie","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r910142379-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"592","265817067","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/d8/0b/eb/dipanjan-d.jpg","592","43","216","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Don2009Kolkata","Dipanjan D","66B7B1F6C42BB97BBBE3DB2CF9A6E489",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","Don2009Kolkata",,,,,,,,"The Mall Rd Opp Ropeways, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","The Mall Rd","Opp Ropeways","1156304","30.457487","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.07549","Hotel Mall Palace","204","3.7","20","10","32","86","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d1156304-Reviews-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","https://www.facebook.com/hotelmallpalace.in/"

"Excellent Location and View but needs a lot of Improvement ","2","2022-04","2022-04-10","Location of the hotel is excellent, so is the view from all the valley facing rooms. 
However there is a huge discrepancy in rates,  which is against the Hospitality norms. When enquired on the phone, we were offered a much higher rates' however on a walk in entry, we got a much lower rate. 
The staff is not bothered, they just seemed to be doing their job and getting their salary. No one will wish you or acknowledge you. No one informed us about the check out timings, and some unprofessional lady at the reception started calling us from 10 am in the morning stating ' can we send someone for the luggage' . We understand that all hotels have a check out time, but unless informed to a guest prior, the hotel management cannot force it upon them. The luggage boys literally barged into our room and grabbed on to our half packed bags and carried them out. In order to chuck us out. The gentleman at the reception made us fill and sign the Rech Card on arrival and next day early morning came running to our room to get some register signed saying 'our boss is here and he is scolding us' Highly Unprofessional!!
The luggage boys / service boys are super greedy, they would stare at your hands for Tip... 
I am amazed even after at all the negative reviews in the past by several other guests, the owner and the management doesnt seem to do anything about it.

The hotel has good scope if the owner looks into his business seriously and gets better trained staff. 

The only good part of our stay was the view from our balcony.  The check out experience spoilt our stay- Constant rude calls from the unprofessional lady and the greedy luggage boys.

"Worst Place in Mussoorie","1","2021-09","2021-10-01","This hotel is the worst place to go in Mussoorie. Not at all recommended. The owner is probably the rudest person you will ever meet. They do not stay true to their commitments.

Below are the main issues:

1. Rooms have a water problem wherein they are constantly damp.
2. The hotel owner is an unpleasant man who is a thief and will overcharge you at any given opportunity.
3. The rooms have holes in their doors wherein sometimes monkeys can even enter your room.
4. The washrooms are damp and have very loud exhausts which you will be able to hear in the room as well.
5. The beds have no lumbar support whatsoever and will give you back problems within a day.

All in all, a place to be avoided at all costs.

"Hotel with excellent view","5","2020-03","2021-01-14","Very good hotel near the ropeway station. You can get an excellent view of valley at day time and aeroplane window view of Dehradun city at night from the attached balcony. The property is just 1.5 km away from popular library chowk.

Room was super neat and clean. Stuffs were helpful and very courteous. Food was also delicious too. Though the hotel is slightly costly but definitely value for money.  Only issue was hotel is located in slightly uphill area, so each time when you are coming from outside you have to climb few stairs.

Cycle rickshaws are available just from outside of the hotel and taxis are from library chowk for sightseeing purpose.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r781140955-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"452","108680878","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/7a/56/ae/smboser.jpg","379","42","116","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smboser","Subhramalya B","8FCD33C57471FF2AEF8C5E4A6BA36B75",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","smboser",,,,,,,,"The Mall Rd Opp Ropeways, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","The Mall Rd","Opp Ropeways","1156304","30.457487","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.07549","Hotel Mall Palace","204","3.7","20","10","32","86","56","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d1156304-Reviews-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","https://www.facebook.com/hotelmallpalace.in/"
"Good Location","3","2020-01","2020-01-20","Well this  property is at very good location. Just in the center of mall road & opposite rope way.

I was a bit worried for the parking but they have parking space as well.

I stayed here for 1 night with family & it was good experience.

The view from room is awesome, my room was on 4th Floor with balcony. 

They provide room heater on chargeable basis which is a bit strange & also no Break fast included in booking.

"Not recommended for Kids & Elderly people","3","2019-11","2019-11-13","The hotel has good infrastructure and ambiance but maintenance is very poor, may be they are short of manpower. Secondly, It is located on the mall road but at a very good height which has around 40-45 stairs to climb and at a steep height.

**Service** - The hotel service is very poor, they don't even provide the basic amenities like hand towel, toilet paper roll, bathroom slippers and very slow in responding to your queries. One has to request then only they will provide all the things.

**Accommodation** - Not very good, though it is very hyped for their location and view but their balcony is too small and you can get the same location view from many points on mall road.

**Food** - They do not have a restaurant but they provide in room service and the food is good in taste as well.

**Location** - Easy to reach as it's on main mall road only, but like I said they are at very good height and if you are travelling with family by your own car, you are not allowed to enter on mall road after 4.30 PM. And the worst part is the hotel doesn't provide any shuttle service and from mall road entrance to Hotel it is about 2 Km which you have to walk, because even rickshaws are not allowed in that distance. And if you reach before 4.30 PM then be ready to climb 40-45 stairs and some walk on height as well.

Overall, I would not recommend this Hotel unless they improve their services like PROVIDING SHUTTLE service, fasten their in room service. respond quickly to your services and most importantly provide basic amenities.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r726323534-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"50","300417710","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/e8/02/ae/nipun-g.jpg","50","7","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/948nipung","Nipun G","792CB7B8A547FBF6C1BDBE7F5B4A6ADE",,,,,"948nipung",,"General Manager","737000655","en","2020-01-05","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Disappointing","2","2019-10","2019-11-10","They have cheated showing good pictures of the hotel on the MMT but provided room in the adjacent old small building. The main building had ~ 5 floors & looks better from outside and the old one had 3 floors. Although it was off season & I booked Executive balcony room, but they refuse to provide  room in the main building and on higher floor, in spite of several requests. The Hotel is almost mid of library chowk (~ 1Km.) and Picture palace (~0.7 Km.) thus if one came by taxi or hired vehicle then option to reach the hotel by walk from the library chowk/ Picture palace or by rikshaw from Librery chowk till Jhula ghar (~ 50 m from the hotel). Private vehicle can enter the mall road paying toll. Hotel is about 30 steps up from the road climb through narrow stairs. Outside view was not very clear due to dense fog/ cloud during my 2 days stay in Mall Palace. Service was good and they tried to solve the problem. Food (Room service only) taste was not good & expensive. Payment only by cash. There are many better food options available @ library chowk and towards Picture palace. Although it was a good stay but disappointed due to their deception.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r725562877-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452387615","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg","1200","5","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SIDH_KOL","SIDH_KOL","33C9B5E90176DED29811D93FD1B3091A",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","SIDH_KOL",,"General Manager","737000540","en","2020-01-05","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Warm hospitality, amazing staff and food—but poor experience with manager","4","2025-06","2025-07-11","We had a mostly wonderful stay here, but unfortunately one issue with the manager left a sour taste.

The property itself is charming, the food was fresh and delicious, and the staff went above and beyond—especially in caring for my elderly grandmother, who stayed in the room alone. Their kindness and attentiveness were deeply appreciated. The owner was also incredibly helpful and accommodating—he allowed us to secure our reservation with a 25% down payment due to our concerns about sending large amounts via UPI without a proper booking guarantee. That gave us peace of mind.

Now the downside: the manager, Anish, was extremely rude from the start. He refused to provide a proper bill initially and insisted UPI was the only payment option. We were a group of four at first, and had booked accordingly. When a fifth member decided to join, they booked a separate room themselves. At that point, we should’ve only been charged for one extra person, but Anish charged me ₹1,000 extra for their room, even though we had made it explicitly clear that we wanted our payments and bills kept separate. We didn’t realize the mistake until after handing over cash—at which point they refused to refund me and instead asked us to collect the amount from the other party member. Anish was dismissive and unpleasant throughout the interaction.

Rooms were a bit below our expectations in terms of cleanliness, but the staff cleaned promptly and brought us fresh towels. A dehumidifier would have helped, as the room felt damp. Also, two electrical outlets burned out when using the heater provided, which made us hesitant to use it much after that.

We would absolutely consider coming back—the setting, food, and staff made it a memorable stay—but only if we didn’t have to deal with the same manager again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r1017705483-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"640","109397523","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/85/46/13/jxn-blues.jpg","640","4","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderfulwonderer","Shivalika Singh","3F27E2769F05B0073762A7310D3FCDFB",,"43833","Jackson, Mississippi","Jackson","wanderfulwonderer",,,,,,,,"Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"
"A Quaint Stay With The Much Needed Respite From the Main Town","5","2023-01","2023-01-17","The property that provides a homely ambiance along with good food, clean rooms, hot water and a breathtaking view of the mountains where, on a clear day you will be able to see the Himalayas!! What hasn't been mentioned anywhere is the stellar view of the night sky one can enjoy from a small deck they have on the 1st floor. You can even count the stars on a clear night!!! And I am sure to share some of the picturesque snaps that I took of the place. George Everest house is a two km hike from Seegreen and you even get to head to on of the most haunted places in Asia - Lambi Dehar Mines where 50,000 labourers had died a painful death and you can still hear their screams in the night! If you are into birding, Benof Bird Santuary is around five km from the property. You can hire a bike for INR 800 and head there.

P.S. - The Seegreen Cafe serves the best pizza in the whole of Mussoorie! And I drolled over their pakoras and chilly cheese toast too. But do bear in mind, this is a slow cafe. So sit back, relax and enjoy the ambiance while you wait for the delectable eatables.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r875427183-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"50","262800886","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/aa/05/f6/sinchita-s.jpg","50","23","174","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SinchitaS2","Sinchita S","40B012BF54AFBEC4DCB34D55E947C51D",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","SinchitaS2",,,,,,,,"Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"

"Review on see green lodge hathi paon Mussourie","2","2022-08","2022-08-20","I stayed at the see green lodge in 17 and 18 Aug 22. The lodge is over rated. Location of the lodge is on a tri junction which is noisy and dirty due to plastic waste. It gives no scenic view what so ever. Free parking implies parking on the road side. Rooms are dingy, dirty with a peculiar stench. The linen provided is pathetic. The towels are displayed are way to old and can't be used. The property didn't have a generator power back up hence you can not have hot water. The staff is staying next to the the guest rooms making noise, using facilities meant for the guests and appalling to see the staff eating meals in the main cafe, brushing their teeth and watching videos in the presence of the guests. They are least helpful in terms of any assistance or Local information. The cafe and the rooms are full of flies and insects. The general cleanliness and behaviour of the staff needs lot of improvement. OVER ALL A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r855213123-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452386713","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","1200","0","119","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skahol","Sanjay Kahol","430FC8B1B00668C8420925218E1390D5",,,,,"skahol",,"General Manager","862828107","en","2022-10-01","Vicky C","hello guest. you chose aug 15/16/17. these dates witnessed crazy rush due to vengeance tourism after covid. we regret that you could not get to experience the serenity and peace of the place. hope you choose another date more wisely","Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"
"One of Mussoorie's best places to stay","5","2022-04","2022-05-02","After being on the road for nearly 3 months in North east India, we were looking for a quiet, peaceful and beautiful place to unwind for a couple of days before we began our journey to Ladakh. Seegreen Lodges was just what we needed. The place is surrounded by trees and mountains on all sides and one can see and hear birds and other animals going about their day, oblivious to our presence. The room was clean and comfortable with a spectacular view. The best part was talking to Sanjeev over delicious cuisine in the cafe downstairs. The variety of cuisine is vast and ranges from chocolate chip cookies to Mussoorie delicacies. There are amazing places to check out nearby. We liked that the place is close enough to the town but is not in the crowded part of Mussoorie so one can hear birds chirping over cars honking :) We did have a little confusion with the location on Google maps so I would highly recommend calling ahead and ensuring the route you plan on taking is accurate. Sanjeev is very helpful and will provide quick and clear instructions. The staff is friendly and helpful. Seegreen has been added to our list of favourite places to visit and we can't wait to visit again. Thank you, Sanjeev and team for the amazing stay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r836925549-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452389009","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1200","1","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaheartsGoa","Patricia","DDA3024ED6628CF64C418C0907285B88",,,,,"PatriciaheartsGoa",,"General Manager","862819312","en","2022-10-01","Vicky C","Dear Guest,

"Beautiful location ,cozy rooms ,amazing food and hospitality.","5","2022-03","2022-04-04","We stayed at Seegreen lodges from 28 th of March until 30 of March. We were in a group of 6 adults and 2 kids. 
The place has a very positive energy and gorgeous views.
We had booked three rooms and one log hut. The rooms were clean and cozy   And the log hut was like a small Swiss chalet complete with an attic . The log hut had the most amazing views of the mountains. The log hut can accommodate a family of 4 easily. 
Seegreen lodges has a namesake cake which serves the best pizzas in Mussoorie.
The first night we stayed there Vicky and Amisha ( the owners ) had arranged for a barbecue . The food was ( both veg and non veg) delicious.
The paranthas that they serve for breakfast are something I would really go back for . The Rhododendron sharbat and the chutney they served was a very personal touch and was out of this world . 
All in all I would definitely want to visit this place again in winter as the pictures we saw were surreal.

"Even better than our last visit","5","2021-12","2021-12-27","We reviewed this place in 2016 after staying there in winter 15. The place is largely unchanged but maintained well. Clean and spare. Excellent and knowledgable staff who absolutely do not hover but available when needed. The pahadi dinners we had were excellent as was the pahadi tea.  Breakfast was included and substantial. In fact all food portions are quite big.

Walls are paper thin so plan to speak softly, which anyway is a good idea. 

Weekdays are quiet and uncrowded. I reccommend visiting on weekdays to avoid the weekend crowd downstairs in the cafe. Alternately do like we did and just leave on a day long trek to get away from the crowd.

"100% visit","5","2021-11","2021-11-14","This beautiful place is perfectly located far enough from the main town so that you get peace & quiet and just close enough so that you can easily walk / bike / drive to Mussoorie which is 3-4km away.
Seegreen is an ideal spot to make your base whether you want to spend time outdoors / just laze all day / access Mussoorie & Landour. There are several walks / hikes which literally begin from the moment you step out of the cafe -- highly recommend Benong Bird Sanctuary -- it's about 10k there & back -- very pretty, did it alone and was super happy to not see any people through the entire hike.
The log hut is extremely peaceful, charming with brick & wood interiors, away from the main cafe & well secluded if you are looking for your own space through your stay. Tama, their pahaadi dog is a top companion who you might just find lazing around the deck with you and making cute faces, asking for belly rubs.
Cafe food is great -- we thoroughly enjoyed the Indian food, but really, everything we ordered was on point. Must mention - loved to be greeted with big smiles and ready to do attitudes from the staff -- Suvinder, Gudvir & Biraj who all made sure we were comfortable.
Wifi works like a dream.

"Couldn’t recommend it enough","5","2021-11","2021-11-12","Everything about this place just hits the perfect spot. We were staying at the Loghat, what a quaint little place to stay in. It’s just perfect for 2 people. Views are amazing from the bed. Small place to sit outside and sip on their Famous ginger lemon tea. The seegreen cafe has the yummiest food you can find in Mussoorie. From their pizza to their chilli cheese fries are to die for. I would recommend everyone to stay and have all meals here. Massive food variety.  Staff is so kind and ready to help.

Both Viraj and Suvender are warm, friendly and helpful
The food was delicious. 
The doggos are adorable
One Suggestion: The log hut can do with a bigger capacity heater, since the volume is a lot to cover due to the double height

"Excellent experience!","5","2021-06","2021-07-08","We had a phenomenal stay at the Lodges. Excellent aesthetics, Uber hygienic, very well maintained and managed, superb food. 

The outdoor deck with a bench is so amazing - sit, soak in the aroma of the fresh air, play your music, make your cocktails and enjoy the mesmerising view of the Himalayas. In fact the first thing you see when you wake up through the front window screen is the mountains nestled in a picturesque setting. Couldn’t get better. 

What we loved the most, above all these things, is the company of two guests that come as a pact with this stay- the two cuddly munchkins- their domesticated dogs - Bhalu and Tamba- they played with us, slept in our cottage, trekked with us, and guarded us- we certainly are going back to meet these friends of ours soon, and immerse in the same wonderful experience we indulged in back when we were there","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r796139430-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,,,,,"0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Punnyavij","Punnya Vij","74764CCF640BD91820BD4F6606D51A82",,,,,"Punnyavij",,"General Manager","801050244","en","2021-08-01","Vicky C","Dear Punnya,

"Good stay","4","2019-10","2019-11-04","The hotel is on Mall Road, opposite to Ropeways. Location wise good. We booked executive room with balcony. We were alloted room in the fourth floor. From the balcony, the view of Doon valley and other hotels is awesome. The hotel is in higher side and so the view is very wide. The room was spacious. The restaurent was under renovation, but food were available as room service. The main attractions are nearby and the manager and other staffs are very good and very helpful.
The main drawbacks is: No commercial car is allowed in the Mall road.

"Carry your own Bed/Bath Linen","1","2019-03","2019-04-03","Stayed in perhaps the top room category (Executive with Balcony) only to be shortchanged with disgusting bed/bath linen which probably outlived its utility period 5 years back. The provision of complimentary ""tea/coffee"" is subject to the quantity determined by the whims of the housekeeping/room service staff. There's a bunch of local lads running the show here with no inkling of how the hospitality industry operates. They are just too happy smoking, making the corridors outside rooms unbreathable. People post favourable reviews, ignoring these as small niggles which further degrades the standard of hospitality offered to guests at such places.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r663629737-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452390416","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","1200","4","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandy23468","Sandy23468","FBDBA0C928FA3E1A7B8051DCEE73F07C",,,,,"Sandy23468",,"General Manager","664415196","en","2019-04-07","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Beautiful view and helpful staff","4","2019-03","2019-03-21","I had a stay at the hotel for 2 days during the second week of March. I booked the room at having a telephonic conversation with Mr. Ashwyn Aggarwal, I believe he had given me one of his best rooms which had a beautiful balcony and an amazing scenic view of sunset. The room was very spacious and beautiful. As it was off season, I also got the room at a very reasonable price. The best part is that the hotel is situated exactly in the middle of the main market, so all the shops and eatery outlets are at a walking distance. The food served here was also very good and reasonably priced. the entire hotel staff were very warm and helpful (thank you Mr. Praveen & Ms. Pooja). They assisted me to plan my visit well, because of which i was able to almost visit all the beautiful spots. There was a big family during the same time of my stay and they used the garden premises for playing games, singing songs and having good quality time together. A highly recommended hotel from my end. A big thank you to the hotel staff for making my stay beautiful and memorable.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r660068173-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452392144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","1200","6","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel_diary13","swati","B40B779C28E30495C5CF5ABECCD36AF1",,,,,"travel_diary13",,"Guest Relations Manager","660489192","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Ms Baid,

"Loved the stay!","4","2018-12","2018-12-19","I visited this hotel from 11 Dec to 14 Dec 2018 with family. It’s a nice hotel with a very good view from the balcony along with the friendly staff. It is located opposite to the Gun hill ropeway and 15 mins walk from the library chowk. They have small parking which can accommodate 5-6 cars though the parking is a bit tricky. 

We went for executive balcony room from where you can see lush green valleys. The room was neat along with the bad linings and pillow. The washroom was clean though the bowl is located between washbasin and a bathroom glass which makes it slightly difficult to accommodate an average size Indian.

We’re genuinely sorry to hear that your much-anticipated trip did not meet your expectations.
Regarding the couple shoot, it was a quiet event happening in another corner of the property. When you raised your concern, we promptly asked the other guests to stop, and they were very cooperative. Later in the evening, you even had dinner with them, which we hope was enjoyable.
We also offered to accommodate you at our other property when you expressed concerns, but you declined that option.

"Expected a tasteful property and friendly staff. But not so. much more.","2","2024-10","2024-10-02","IT WAS OUR FIRST TIME WITH SECLUDE AND WE WERE NOT SATISFIED with the property on many fronts. First the room is not upto the mark if u compare the amount we are spending. And specially you should not sell it as 3 sharing. I haven't paid good amount to sleep on a cot in the coridor. 
  Cleanliness is not upto the mark. There was one area in the room behind glass door, although not useable but still has to be clean bc it is part of room. 
      AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ATTITUDE OF STAFF. SPECIALLY THE MANAGER WAS NOT AT ALL FRIENDLY. HIS BODY LANGUAGE IS LIKE PLS DONT MAKE ANY REQUEST WE WILL PROVIDE AS PER OUR LIKING. 
      AND FINALLY WE HAVE TO PAY RS. 500 PER DAY FOR THE PARKING🥵.  WE WERE INTIMATED ROAD SIDE PARKING IS AVAILABLE BUT ON REACHING THERE WE WERE ASKED TO PAY FOR PARKING IN ADVANCE.

If you're someone who appreciates effortless design and aesthetics, this place is a treat to be at. The common areas cover almost all kinds of sitting for you to comfortably lounge in. 

And, most importantly, the staff is very warm and welcoming. They'll leave no stone unturned to make you feel like your most comfortable self. The food's pretty good as well - I tried dal, rice, rotis, aloo jeera (more like sindhi crispy aloo tuk) and shahi paneer, and they were all delicious.

If you're looking for a quiet getaway place surrounded by scenic beauty and nature, this is the place to be.

"Excellent service makes the difference","5","2018-10","2018-12-02","We were 7 people & booked 3 balcony rooms in 5th floor via MMT. The hotel is on Mall Road - just opposite to GunHill ropeway starting point. 

Pros:
1. Neat & clean & spacious rooms & bathrooms with necessary modern amenities
2. 24 hours hot water available
3. Lift available
4. Excellent service - whatever you need, you will get it in 5 min. If they need more time (like for dinner to serve), they will clearly communicate that. 
5. All staffs are very polite, well-behaved & knows how to handle their customer
6. Parking facility is available. We checked out at around 10:15 and they allow us to keep our car at their parking place till 1.
7. Their is an amazing view of Doon valley from the balcony.
8. Foods are tasty

Cons:
1. Foods are tasty, but very expensive. 

Note:
1. Cars are not allowed in Mall road between 4 pm & 10 pm. So if you are coming Mussorie by car, please keep it in mind.
2. The hotel is around 1 km from Gandhi Chowk & rickshaw fare is 50/-

Overall highly recommended...","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r637071578-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452386535","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","1200","23","43","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoutamSett","GoutamSett","278A1E0978E58618DBEF0B0681A61214",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","GoutamSett",,"Guest Relations Manager","637786124","en","2018-12-06","MALLPALACE","Dear Mr Sett,

"Nice room, amazing view from balcony.","5","2018-10","2018-10-31","Apart from the gloomy staircase and corridors and some weirdly designed entrance, this hotel is a nice pick in mall road . I did the mistake of going to Mussoorie without booking a hotel  but I got lucky and I got their last room at 8 Pm for a fair price. I liked the room, it was big and clean, their bathroom had a shower cubicle which I appreciated so much because after a hectic driving , it was great enjoying a hot shower.  The room also had a balcony through which you can see the valley ; at night and early morning it is a real treat. The only problem is that there is no WI-FI in the rooms, you should go sit at their reception to use it which is frankly ridiculous. I would stay there again and I would recommend it to a friend but I hope they fix the WIFI problem.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r629980098-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"50","156866675","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/59/98/73/amounain.jpg","50","33","28","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amounain","Amounain","C773F5180BC85A56EDEBC7492356320A",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Amounain",,"Guest Relations Manager","630264815","en","2018-11-02","MALLPALACE","Dear Ms Amounain,

"Summer Holidays","5","2018-04","2018-04-03","It is an excellent hotel on Mall road, equal distance from Gandhi Chawk and Picture palace, with excellent view of the valley. The hotel is just infront of Gun hill rope ways. I stayed in room no 301 and 302 which has a private terrace, an icing on the cake. Though on the mall road, hardly any noise. The benefit is all the good eateries like Kalsang, lovely omlete center, myshop etc are nearby , 200-400 meters of walk.
Only one cons, there is 15-20 stairs you need to climb to reach the reception, but thats all.

"Great comfort","4","2025-07","2025-07-04","I recently spent a week at Jharipani Castle with my elderly parents, and it was a truly memorable experience. The peaceful setting, heritage charm, and stunning views made it an ideal place to unwind and reconnect.

What stood out most, however, was the exceptional hospitality. The entire staff was courteous, attentive, and always willing to help — ensuring that my parents felt comfortable and well taken care of throughout our stay.

A special mention to Hasan ji at the front desk and Sanjay ji for their warmth which made a big difference to our experience. Whether it was arranging transport, guiding us on nearby spots, or simply checking in on our comfort, they were always present with a smile.

Highly recommend Jharipani Castle for anyone looking for a serene, heartfelt getaway — especially with family.

"Home amidst a fairyland","5","2021-02","2021-02-23","This was my second visit to Seegreen lodges. I was here back in January in 2019 and since then I’ve just longed to be back. Hathipaon is a few kilometers off Mall Road and is perfect for a short cozy stay amidst the mountains. Seegreen lodges is a home away from home, the staff is warm and very welcoming and make sure that the guests have a comfortable and an amazing time. 
Somendar, Gudvir and Viraj will go to any extents to make sure that the trip is a success and are well informed about the surroundings. A big thank you to them and hats off to all their efforts to make me feel so comfortable and will urge you to go out into the wilderness and look around and be closer to nature.
Last but not the least the main and the cutest residents of the lodge are Tama and Bhaloo who will steal your hearts in one look. 
Here you can have your delicious meals cooked by Gudvirji, out by the deck surrounded by the calls of various birds that is so damn enchanting.
I already can’t wait to be back here and spend some more time here in this wonderland called Hathipaon.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r783474468-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452390812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg","1200","6","21","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PranayBhartiya4","Pranay","74F4D256A86F8F106AD09673E88E7DA8",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","PranayBhartiya4",,"General Manager","795108871","en","2021-07-01","Vicky C","Thank you Pranay for the lovely review!

"The best start to 2021","5","2021-01","2021-01-09","Seegreeen is honestly the best place we could have hoped for our trip. 
Firstly it's located at Hathipaon,which is a little distance from Mussoorie and is thus the best place to experience calmness and serenity. At the same time it's hardy 10 mins (by car) or 50 mins (by walk) from Library Chowk, and thus the typical Mussoorie places are at an arm's distance. 
Second of all the rooms are very warm and home like. They are spacious enough to have a comfortable stay for 2-3 people. The beds are cosy, the rooms are aesthetically pleasing and the bathroom is neat. 

Thirdly the cafe downstairs serves some amazing food. Although their pasta, pizza, and hot chocolate is something everyone needs to go for, their basic food (dal, chawal, roti, sabzi) is also very delicious for people who wish to eat basic Indian food. 

Lastly the staff and the owner are very warm and welcoming people. They make sure you feel at home and have an amazing stay.

The staff is extremely courteous, helpful, & full of warmth; and the cafe is a great place to make memories with close ones (do try out their pizzas and hot chocolate, and the local dishes that they prepare on order).

Finally, the presence of the two lovely doggo friends at the premises just made the experience sweeter!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r780832886-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","1","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShivamV98","Shivam","A67BAA14B5EDEBED75490979EDA79000",,,,,"ShivamV98",,"General Manager","795109360","en","2021-07-01","Vicky C","Thank you Shivam!","Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"

"Difficult to sleep due to to plywood walls","3","2020-10","2020-11-01","If you value your undisturbed sleep, then do not stay at the Sea Green lodge in Hathi Paon Mussoorie.

The walls between the rooms are made of plywood and so you can be constantly disturbed by sounds from those in the room next to you.

In our case, on day one night, the couple in the next room had a long periodic argument that lasted most of the night. We were finally able to get some peace and quiet only at 4 AM.

The next night, the new guests checked in around 13.0AM. For almost the next one hour, their creaking door kept opening and shutting.  Again we were able to fall asleep only around 3 AM. And at 6AM they started playing music. And so goodbye sleep….

But to be balanced, the food is very tasty, and the staff are helpful. By all means, use the Sea Green café during the day, but think twice before spending the night.  

One of the reasons we selected the Sea Green Lodge was to chill in the day in what seemed to be per their website their large luxurious lawns. But once we had checked in, we discovered there are no lawns at that we could go sit on – only some meadows around 10-15 minutes walk away. This came as quote a shock. 

In terms of the ambience, the Sea Green Lodge is comfortable, but not terribly well maintained. The place seems not to have been repainted for quite some time. The rules also reasonably customer unfriendly. For example, this is the first hotel I have stayed in my life where the hotel staff refuse to give you the Wi-Fi password but insist that you bring them your device for face-to-face interaction - even in these COVID-19 days of social distancing.  And quite a few times, the staffs did not wear masks.

Do stay at the Sea Green Lodge Hathipaon Mussoorie at your own risk.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r776223998-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,,,,,"1","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meander296793","Meander","BDECAE44E7C94226DF19765FCA390D1D",,,,,"Meander296793",,,,,,,,"Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"
"Up above the world so high! Beauty, tranquility and comfort!","5","2020-09","2020-10-18","It’s been over a month since we stayed for a week at the Seegreen Wooden Cabin and we can still feel the afterglow of visiting this hidden away gem in Mussoorie. Never has a hotel or bnb or home stay has touched our lives in such a manner - it’s completely etched in our memories forever and even our lifestyle habits! We ate the best food made by the Seegreen Cafe team with Ustad at the helm, Kamlaji and the super friendly and helpful caretaker Sovendarji; we slept like babies in the cosy log cabin and we even got the necessary workout from climbing to and from the cabin. The views upon waking were breathtaking and we still can’t stop thinking about the sunsets! The amazing masala chai and ginger-lemon-honey tea were always available to us and we sure had our unlimited share. The tariff and pricing at the cafe are so affordable that we even thought about staying longer. We’d go back to Seegreen in a heartbeat! It’s changed us in so many ways, we wake up earlier, feel refreshed and we will forever be grateful to the owners Sanjeev and his wife (who were staying just next to us at their holiday home) for creating this marvellous hideaway. Thank you so much for your generous hospitality, we absolutely can’t recommend Seegreen enough!

Only bad thing is the sitting space for Commod in bathroom.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r562054949-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1836","832592006","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/31/a0/58/86/caption.jpg","1836","9","43","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manish_Dutta","Manish Kumar Dutta","3CF1AB3909B2BC5257536D02C2F9A56A",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","Manish_Dutta",,"Guest Relations Manager","572828137","en","2018-04-12","MALLPALACE","Dear Mr Dutta,

"Awesome view Paisa Vasool Property","4","2017-11","2017-11-19","Stayed there for 3 nights during an off peak season in November. Stayed in Executive Suit with Independent Balcony on 5th Floor. Rooms have been renovated and have a chick style. View from the balcony is awesome and its just next to Ropeway . Paisa vasool due to the rates they offered in off peak season otherwise all hotels are overpriced. They do not have complimentary breakfast option and dinner was ok. Service was good and staff was courteous. The main attraction:-
1) Just mid way on Mall road.You can go to library chowk or Mall road from here. 
2)Everything is around this hotel.
3)Lots of eating options near by.Sagar Ratna, Dominos, chats etc.
4)Parking is available,
5)Room have 24 hrs hot water.

I booked an executive room with terrace(common for all rooms). No problem at all. Parking is also there but your hill driving skill will be tested. 

This is a budget property so I would not like to get in to much details but you get more than what you pay for.

"Good budget hotel on Mall Road","4","2016-10","2017-06-07","We stayed there for 2 nights in Oct 2017 with my family. It is a good hotel in mid range budget. Rooms with private balconies are good enough with nice view of the dehradhun valley. I booked the rooms for around 1100/- INR per night. Which is quite cheap. There are some areas where modification needed as this is a old hotel, but rooms are clean with all the modern facilities. The best part of this hotel is the location. It's on the mall road. But if you are having more luggage, it's difficult to enter the hotel as it is bit higher than the road. In that case you can call the reception person and ask for some one to carry your luggage. Fooding is available at the hotel, but they don't have much varieties, and the restaurant use to close down earlier at night by 8:00 pm in the evening. I will recommend this hotel for solo family travelers who need a perfect location within the budget.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r491159477-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452389307","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","1200","4","45","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annieb2k","subhranil b","9D156A1ED64A6734B2D8742D5DAE11CE",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","annieb2k",,"Guest Relations Manager","660492992","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Great place!","4","2017-05","2017-05-17","Our 2 day stay in this hotel was very comfortable. Even in May, Mussoorie remains pleasantly cool. Ours wasn't an AC room, and honestly just a fan was sufficient for us. It turns cold in the evening. The bathrooms have 24-hour hot water supply. The rooms are very clean, spacious and well maintained. The beds have comforters to keep you warm and snug. We didn't eat at their restaurant since we wanted to explore the restaurants in the vicinity (and there are many!)
Once you get to Gandhi Chowk, you will have to take a hand pulled rickshaw which will take you (and your luggage) to the hotel. Vehicles aren't allowed past Gandhi Chowk. The hotel has a flight of stairs to the reception. You might want to hire help to take your luggage up the stairs. I think they have a lift, but it was under renovation at the time of our visit. Their staff is very helpful. You will have to call Housekeeping to clean your room, otherwise they won't come on their own (which is fine). Overall a pleasant stay!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r485178036-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452386535","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","1200","1","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshPra1729","AMK","0CBC5ED896958C32D59BE146BDB0B45B",,,,,"AshPra1729",,"Guest Relations Manager","660493181","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

Rooms were nice and clean.  One can enjoy  nice view of doon valley from balcony.

Hotel was under renovation, that's why restaurant was closed but you can order food and they will deliver to your room.  Food was average so I wood recommend to go out for food.

Because of renovation lift was also not working so I would recommend to choose room on first floor only.  Executive room with balcony will be a good choice.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r481784431-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"50","99786315","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/f2/9e/4b/hemant-v.jpg","50","21","226","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HemantV331","Hemant Varshney","2A4F3FDB953EB28641246BBFA285EB95",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","HemantV331",,"Guest Relations Manager","660493242","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

This is a very picturesque place to stay at. The hospitality of the staff here is top notch. The facilities are great and the two best things about Seclude are the scenic views and the very delicious food. The chef here is a star. The food is very fresh, homely and the yummiest. 😋
The concept of rooms at Seclude is also very interesting. The common place is very pretty. Mr. Illu and Mr. Arvind are very helpful and polite. Mr. Nitin was very helpful throughout and he made sure that our trip was smooth and comforting.😊 This is also very close to Mall Road which makes it even more likeable. The proximity to Mall Road is in a way that the place is secluded from the hustle of the crowd but also not so secluded from the mall road making it a perfect place to stay at. 
I’d highly recommend this place to everyone and make sure that you try the food of this place.

"Terrible Property and Terrible Manager","1","2023-06","2023-06-28","During my recent hotel stay, I had a highly disappointing experience with numerous issues that significantly affected my stay in Seclude Mussorie Firstly, there was a complete lack of maintenance in the rooms, resulting in smelly and poorly maintained spaces. The washrooms had low water pressure, which made it inconvenient to use. Unfortunately, the manager (Nitin )seemed unconcerned about these issues and provided no resolution. Furthermore, after 10 p.m., there was no staff available, leaving guests without any support.

Adding to the frustration, a group of individuals played loud music until the early hours of the morning, causing disturbances and hindering sleep. However, amidst the challenges, I must acknowledge the helpfulness of some staff members, particularly the cook and Mukesh, who provided support within their limitations.

The property itself was misleading, as the rooms were shabby and not reflective of the photos provided during booking. Moreover, most rooms lacked windows and air conditioning, leading to discomfort and suffocation.

I strongly advise potential guests to exercise caution before booking a room at this hotel, as the high prices charged do not align with the poor quality and lack of amenities.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d8435492-r898612317-Seclude_Mussoorie-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391608","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","1200","4","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee28231536640","Sightsee28231536640","DC1CD8996E50D9E3E360D2F4DB3BA621",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Sightsee28231536640",,"Guest Services / Front Office","919113922","en","2023-09-30","Seclude Hotels","We apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced during your stay.

"Unethical","1","2023-05","2023-06-18","There is a thin line between making a fair amount of profit in a business and in the name of business absolutely fooling your customers.
U cannot say i am running a hospitality business and then looting random traveeler!
Their representative from Delhi Mr. Krishna said the trarrif is 8.5k for a night.. we made full payment coz he followed up with me within one hour saying we cannot wait longer. Booked for 5day.
And when we stay at the property. We see dust, hair , durty bed spreads, dead fly, dirty room mats, the room So so dusty the me and my 1.5yr old both were allergic to the dust and sneezed the entire day .
Power cuts!
And a person whose name is Nithin who is supposed to be the manager, least interested.. absolutely uninvolved.
When i tried to get in touch with the Delhi team. They asked me to write an email..bought time..made me wait..basically wanted the 5 days to pass.They stopped responding. 
Completely disappeared!
The only thing that helpful was their cook and few staff who tried to do something and help us in their limits..the basic ethics that those staffs have that u don't see amongst people who are educated, sitting elsewhere and charging random tarrifs to people!

It's such a shame to have come across people like this .. makes us think how far is our country from being developed on these terms? Can someone really get away by charging u as much as 8.5k per night and offer u room full of dust?
Is this why the rich gets richer and the poor still goes to bed hungry in our country?","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d8435492-r895765443-Seclude_Mussoorie-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452390984","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg","1200","3","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BindiyaK12","Bindiya K","4591DD5C6FD40D4EF3C2DD91BE6FADE8",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","BindiyaK12",,"Guest Services / Front Office","901346670","en","2023-07-08","Seclude Hotels","We regret that you had such an experience with us.

"Choose wisely!!! Be clear between Hotel or Villa, this is not a hotel!!!","3","2023-06","2023-06-05","For travellers who are deciding on Hotel booking vs a villa experience booking!! We had a family reunion and we chose seclude mussoorie  and booked entire property directly with seclude instead of any other website for which we were asked to deposit full amount one month prior to our  staying date, considering an amount of 2.2 lacs for 7 rooms, 4 days with breakfast and dinner. After payment of 1st installment which was 1.1 lacs, second installment we had to pay immediately with in 7 days, otherwise they would cancel the booking and forfeit our advance amount. So we paid the full amount. 
Stay experience, the rooms are not maintained as shown in pictures, food is home cooked but the spread of food is poor (photo) people should finalize menu while booking, no power backup, no parking consider paying rs.400/day/car as parking fees, wifi connection but very poor, staff is good, services are time limited consider max 10 pm, thereafter after 8am, staff is eager to leave by that time, so we have to wind up according to them to finish our dinner. Hope this helps!!

"A homely place in a hill","4","2023-04","2023-05-31","It’s more of a cosy hostel, well serviced and with needed amenities. The welcome is warm and services are with a smile. One has to be fit to handle the steep approach & once up there the property gives such beautiful valley views. Good, tasty food served. Next best in Mall Road which is about 10-15 minutes walk away. The beauty spot of the region is Landour and the one hour hike to reach there is amazing. Can also hire a scooter (Nagendra-9761723757) which can be delivered right at Seclude gate and then it’s your joy day driving around. 
Must say the valley view from Purple room was memorable. So are the services provided by the Seclude team headed by Mukesh. 
Can improve - in Purple room - need a cupboard with cloth hangers. Need a partition for the shower area, as the water splashes around and makes the place slippery.

"Yes you only see green ","5","2020-03","2020-03-13","I traveled solo and this place was just perfect for me. Seegreen Lodge is a small place and has only 3 rooms which meant I wouldn’t have to interact with too many people and it also had a 5 star review for its cafe so my food cravings would be well taken care of.

The BnB was better than I had expected. The room was neat and clean and the view from the window amazing.  A special thanks to Somender Ji, the caretaker, and Gudveer ji, the cook, who made sure that I had a very comfortable stay of two nights. The best part was the long walks that I took in the surrounding forests, a total Shinrin-yoku feel. Got to see some amazing views at cloud end and near George Everest house and on the way got to chat with the locals. Some parts were quite steep and tested my lung capacity  but the satisfaction of being able to complete the trails was immense. Also got to see some exotic birds returning to their homes just before sunset. The lodge provided me with a heater in the room for the cold nights and also had hot water in the shower as well as the wash basin.

I loved the food that was served especially the veggie pasta. I would recommend this place to solo travelers, couples and small groups of friends who love nature and quietude. My best wishes to team Seegreen.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r750713206-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"2368","153176528","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/21/49/d0/explorer-in-spirit.jpg","4208","6","155","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explorer_In_Spirit","Explorer_In_Spirit","4169AA19840604C8E1AF3CE2C60BC848",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","Explorer_In_Spirit",,"Owner","750872776","en","2020-03-14","VickyL118","Shinrin yuko feel !!!!!

We chatted for hours sitting by the fire. Believe me, they are a good company. The food was great. the room was amazing. When we woke up in the morning we were simply mesmerized. we took a short stroll to the ruins and wishing well. This is the best hotel experience I've had inside India.

Exotic view, surroundings by beautiful mountains, cozy log hut, private verandah, amazing food and and excellent service provided . It’s quite beautifully constructed and is a great getaway not just for couples and friends but for families too. Couple trails near by to cloud end are loaded with natural beauty, deep valley views, beautiful flora on the way and quiet and serene . Our son enjoyed the trails a lot! Excellent place for thinkers and writers! Staff is very accommodating and flexible with food choices. One of the best part is the place is quite clean and hygiene is very well maintained . 30 min away from mussorie and may be an hour away from dehradun. Excellent location , easy to find and also well connected with near by cities . Camping , bird watching , star gazing can be planned. 
We would love to visit again and this time probably for for a longer duration.

Its about 4 KMS away from Mall road, so you are away from the hustle bustle of the Mall road, while still close enough to enjoy the town. It was a serene environment right in the middle of nature. We stayed at the their log cabin - which was perfect for our family of 3. It had a nice loft where kids could enjoy. The room is constructed with all natural material and truly gives nice vibes of being in the nature. The big glass window provided amazing views in the morning. In the morning, we walked for upto Cloud's End (about 2 Kms) and got some really cool pics. They have a good restaurant. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast there. We took Roti-sabzi, Rice-daal, Parathas, Pakoras and Chai. The food was freshly prepared and good taste. The owners happened to be there at the property, they sat down with us for friendly chat and gave us lots of tips about the area.

The instructions on water conservation is creatively written and it makes you understand the journeyof water. The rooms are clean and cosy that makes your stay comfortable.

"A Peaceful Escape at Jharipani Castle","5","2025-02","2025-04-04","Once again, I find myself drawn back to Jharipani Castle my favourite little escape tucked away in the hills. There’s something undeniably special about this place that words can scarcely capture. My room, small yet wonderfully cosy, sits quietly amidst a cascade of natural plants, giving the entire space a sense of calm and seclusion. It’s independent and peaceful, allowing one to truly disconnect from the outside world.

The charm of Jharipani Castle lies not only in its beautiful surroundings but also in the atmosphere it radiates. The air feels fresher, the mornings are quieter, and every corner seems to hum with gentle, positive energy. It’s not just a place to stay; it’s a space to breathe, to reflect, and to simply be. Whether you’re sipping tea on the balcony as mist rolls over the mountains or enjoying a walk among the greenery, every moment here feels intentional and grounding.

I often find myself recommending this place to friends and fellow travellers, and I always say the same thing: don’t just believe what I say. Go there, even if it’s only once. Let yourself experience the stillness, the warmth, and the honest beauty that Jharipani Castle offers. There’s a rare kind of peace in this place one that stays with you long after you’ve left. So, if you’re ever in need of a quiet retreat surrounded by nature, let this little gem welcome you with open arms.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d649120-r1001086544-Jharipani_Castle-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452389554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","0","35","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annavaramg2024","Annavaram G","C1D1B7D4CF30B42FFB75A066C092C5F4",,"5869869","Annavaram, India","Annavaram","annavaramg2024",,,,,,,,"Jharipani Castle, Patiala House , Jharipani, Opp State Bank of India, Near Oak Grove School, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Jharipani Castle, Patiala House , Jharipani, Opp State Bank of India, Near Oak Grove School",,"649120","30.42432","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.08439","Jharipani Castle","884","4.8","14","7","6","100","757","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d649120-Reviews-Jharipani_Castle-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.jharipanicastle.com"

"Lovely view from all the rooms, good location","4","2016-02","2016-12-31","Positive
1.	Great view of the valley from all the rooms as all the rooms have front facing balconies.
2.	Rooms were clean and very well lit.
3.	Lots of shops around to do shopping. 
4.	Do not forget to taste the innovative omelets at  the famous “Lovely Omelette Centre.
It is about 0.5 km away from the hotel. Amazing omelets. There is a South Indian restaurant near the omelet centre for those who prefer vegetarian food. 

Negative
Food quality was not up to the mark.

"Best stay in the 'queen of hills'","4","2016-10","2016-10-25","Hotel Mall Palace is located on the mall road but slightly away from the main area of mall road. You can walk down the mall road or take rickshaws which charges Rs. 50 for two and Rs. 30 for one.
The rooms are very cozy and comfortable. They were very well furnished, with toiletries provided. We stayed in deluxe terrace which had two entrances. One gate opens to the terrace that has tables where you can sit, eat and relax and enjoy the view of Doon valley. The hotel since located at a height gives the best view of Doon valley. Deluxe terrace is located in the second floor and the hotel has lift making our stay comfortable. There are also rooms with private balcony located both in second and third floors. But we still preferred the terrace rooms because of the beautiful layout. Since we were 4 members, we were provided with interconnecting rooms which was really good.
The hotel staffs gave excellent service and I can surely say that of all the places I have visited, their service is something I will always remember.
The food was delicious and the service was quick.
The hotel has free wifi but only in the reception. It would be really helpful if they extend that service.
Since the hotel is located quite inside the mall road, there is no entry of commercial vehicles. Private vehicles can enter till 4:30 pm. Rickshaws are available at the beginning of mall road and also in front of the hotel to facilitate your walk up and down the mall road.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay in Mall palace and would thank them for their excellent service!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r431561831-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391715","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg","1200","2","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sohini_6","Sohini_6","9D83AE3DCFFCD5EBEA29D9ED5D8B99BD",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","Sohini_6",,"Guest Relations Manager","660493594","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Nice Hotel at Very Nice Location","4","2016-08","2016-08-16","I somehow make the blunder and booked hotel for next month same dates. Hence I ended up in the manager cabin instead of hotel room after tired journey but that guy was really very calm and great person who helped me out by making my booking with luckily urgent booking and also offered me to try other places with lower price range first if I want till than he will try to hold back this room. 

Staff was well behaved and I ordered dinner only once during two days stay but it was really very good in taste. Hotel was clean and taking care of hygiene. Balcony view was so soulful that sunset was amazing to be watched from there. Best thing about that hotel was that it was in center of the Mall Road. Jhoolaghar is just few steps away which will take you to Gun Hill View Point.

To Conclude the complete experience i will took same hotel if it will be available whenever i will go to Mussoorie again.

"Nice Located Mid range Hotel for families","3","2016-06","2016-07-02","We booked the Hotel online in 2 days advance and we got it @ 4k per room/night. We had booked 2 rooms for 3 nights in June which was a peak season. We got 1 Executive Balcony(room 1) and 1 Executive Bathtub (room 2)(that's how they distinguish in rooms). The Executive balcony room was better with wooden flooring, exclusive balcony with Mall road view and Synthetic Grass on the floor of balcony. Other Room was OK, although bigger than the first one but the balcony was actually a huge common terrace. switches for charging were lesser in 2nd room, we had to remove TV plug to charge our phones. the first room had enough charging points. 
Food was average, Parking was available which was helpful but the restricted entry timings on Mall road gave us a headache. 
Overall price charged online was lower than mentioned on the Reception due to peak season but it was not worth that much although the Manager told us that he has upgraded our rooms. Wifi was only available at reception area.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r388437568-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"50","190342097","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/58/63/d1/puru-g.jpg","50","12","44","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PURUG7","PURU G","F7845A10C6081280F87601E6CE806E71",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","PURUG7",,"Guest Relations Manager","660494045","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

When we reached hotel, we were little early. Despite of having vacant room, manager didnt give us room to freshen up only.

"Decent Hotel @ Good Location","4","2016-04","2016-04-29","Visited Mussoorie in mid April'16 & had a stay in this hotel. Hotel is good for stay. Located just at the MALL Road & also it is very close to Gun Hill Rope way. This can be considered as a plus point also.
But as bcoz rope way is close, one can hear the voice of ""Rope Way motor"" inside the room (which is facing Mall road ) continuously. timings for rope way is 09:00 am till 07:30 PM. so you can imagine the noise one has to bear with.
Leaving the above, rest it is a good hotel in terms of nearness to shops, market, eateries, MAll Road etc etc. You just come down from the hotel & you are into the Mall Road mkt.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r368675261-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"205","19820636","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/5c/avatar034.jpg","205","24","28","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SumitShrivastava504","SumitShrivastava504","E06D76E820EB6D205B12EBF50D5FD0A1",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","SumitShrivastava504",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498407","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Nature, Peace, Quiet walking trails in the mountains, Birds, Home cooked food and warm service","5","2019-10","2019-10-12","We got a very warm welcome from the host, Vicky and the manager, Somunder. Room was very cosy and clean. The Cafe, where in all meals are served was just below the rooms. The taste of the food was fresh at the same time delicious, was informed by the cook, Gudveer that most of the ingredients were sourced from local villages. The view of the mountains and the deep green forest from the room was spectacular. Also spotted many birds including scops owl, it is a good idea to carry a DSLR. The place is extremely quiet, pleasant - tweeting of birds is the only sound I heard in my room. The air was clean and fresh, guess I got my quota of oxygen leaving me rejuvenated.
Seegreen is a gateway to many pleasant and quiet walking trails. We went on a number of them, the one to Wishing Well and Clouds End stand out. Unfortunately could not venture out for a trek to George Everest point due to time factor, will definitely take up on my next trip.

I am surely going to be back for a longer stay in the near future, full heartedly recommend SeeGreen to all nature loving enthusiasts.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r717820550-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391715","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg","1200","2","20","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bhanas","Bhana","5CFCB95D05E135891C3F59EA201FCD9E",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","Bhanas",,"Owner","720324428","en","2019-10-21","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

We had an amazing view, we watched several species of birds, himalayan range and experience the real silence. Several walking trails are around the lodge, it made our experience most memorable. 

Cafe located just below our room was highlight of our trip, we had some mouth watering local cuisine to fired pizza. It is fairly priced with high quality ingredients. Service at cafe was outstanding and we were informed that everything at the cafe is freshly cooked.

"Love this place, calm, in arms of the nature and beautiful","4","2019-09","2019-09-20","This place is none less than heaven, see green lodge made of wood gives the feeling you are staying with mother nature, balcony, views around it, changing the landscape within a minute will make you amaze and will make you fall in love with nature.
Take a hot cup of tea, sit and relax on beautifully designed chair for your comfort and forget everything else.
I love a few unique things about this place.
Despite competition these days to provide the best service to the customer, this place urges you to be best to your nature. You will not find everything perfect here, but living with those imperfections, will surely make you perfect caretaker of nature.
I like the note in washroom how we can save water, how we can keep things and live days over there to leave minimum or no chemical footprint to nature.
All the members here are like family, Somender was hero of this trip, he helped me with lots of stuff, from making cutome tea, providing warm water for my ill friend, to drive us from mall road in heavy rain.
I admire this guy, chance to met Vicky as well, very nice guy and could smell simplicity and nature love from this place.

"Their log hut is perfect for a quiet getaway!","5","2019-08","2019-09-17","My partner and I stayed in the log hut for 4 nights - it's perfect for a quiet, green getaway. We could see mist and mountains from our bed, and the private sitout  was perfect for journaling in the mornings, reading in the afternoons and stargazing at night. The hospitality of the staff was commendable: they were welcoming and responsive to all our requests, but non-intrusive. The food is well made, nourishing ghar ka khana. I have several dietary restrictions, and the cook Gudvir was extremely accommodating and flexible about using the ingredients I could eat in the food.  There are lovely walks and quiet spots around - the walks to George Everest's House, Cloud's End, as well as the Library Chowk in Mussoorie were largely quiet and scenic. There are several forest paths as well, though we didn't explore them as it was rainy weather. All in all, Seegreen is perfect for anyone who wants a quiet getaway within an hour's walk from Mussoorie.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r710519715-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","1","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kandalasingh","Kandala S","30D2BFD727FE5AAFABF176C1729CF418",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","kandalasingh",,"Owner","713287608","en","2019-09-26","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"Mesmerising and cozy","5","2019-08","2019-08-26","This was my second visit to this quaint little place. We spend good times in our cozy room. The view of refreshing greens from the place and sudden mists of monsoon made our stay even more memorable. And of course, to make the stay comfortable, we had the ever smiling and helpful staffs of seegreen lodges. Food was good. We enjoyed every bit of our two-nights stay in this place.

If you want to spend a few days with your loved ones avoiding noises of big cities, this is definitely the place to be. The main Mussorie mall is only 4kms away. Cloud's end is also near to this place. But the best of all, in my opinion (although we couldn't be there this time due to rains) is 2 kms walk to the George Everest's house remains and the valley view from there. 

I would definitely be here if I plan to be near Mussorie in the future.

"Decent budget hotel","3","2016-04","2016-04-17","Hotel is located on Mall road but the problem is FOOD. Hotel restaurant is terrible in service and apart from that there are hardly 2 options, which are good for Breakfast. Lunch is obviously done outside, while you explore the city but dinner is a huge problem. The location forces to walk a km to get some decent place to eat.
Reception service is good but unless they fix the restaurant i will avoid it.

Another negative aspect is the room size. I had booked Executive balcony room, which is the costliest room, excluding the ones with extra bed/people. the room was lacking space for a proper room. 2 people cant even walk side by side for a few steps.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r365012154-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"346","189595793","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/4d/00/91/samyak-j.jpg","461","8","43","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamyakJ","Samyak Jain","4D45C3394DBB0D4C04B8E312EA02561B",,"1062901","Ghaziabad, India","Ghaziabad","SamyakJ",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498461","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Amazing View!","4","2016-04","2016-04-11","Booked through Goibibo and got the deluxe room with terrace for INR 952.The hotel is located around a km from the library bus stand, and hardly 500 m from the marketplace.
The rooms were very spacious and view from the terrace was splendid.Situated just opposite the cable car station , so was able to see the cars going up and down from my room.
The bathroom was spic and span with electric geyser .The best part was that there was no foul smell in the toilets.
Hotel staff were courteous.We informed them beforehand that we would be checking in at 8 AM and they created no major issue while checking in.
They told that ""You do an early checkout by 10 AM the next day as you have done an early check in ,else pay the early check in cost"".Apart from this small issue everything else was good and no complaints at all.The quality of food was also good as we had Omelet and Gobi Parantha for breakfast the day we arrived.The rates are not to expensive.
There was no Wifi range in the third floor though.
Going to recommend this place to my friends as well.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r363264504-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"4480","420283934","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/0d/06/1e/etlrwitharnav.jpg","4480","121","699","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ETLRwithArnav","Arnav Mathur","ADAB3544E5A474F05098222466955AA8",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","ETLRwithArnav",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498475","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Budget Hotel @ Decent location","3","2016-01","2016-01-30","This is a budget hotel with extremely good location.
Right in front of Gunhill ropeway @ Mall Mussoorie.
As far food is concern , I would say is not upto the mark as they had limited option with not so tasty food. Also correction required in food price to make it more value for money(bit overprice relatively to quality). So in terms of food there is a scope of improvement. We though managed good food from outside as hotel is on the mall and all good restaurants are nearby.
 Room& service: We stayed in executive room and room size is OK... not soo big not too small. Facility wise they can improve couple of things like mini bar or hair dryer or other small small things which can make experience even more comfortable.
But balcony overlooking doon valley will give you superb and soothing experience. You will feel that you are really away from city hustle bustle and enjoying the serene environment. Thats the reason you go there right !!!! TOO GOOD IS THE WORD for location.

Staff is efficient and service is pretty quick. They are always ready to serve you.
Overall a decent budget hotel!!

"Stay at this hotel was very basic...pls stay away","2","2015-10","2015-10-31","we booked 4 rooms in Oct 2015 and were shocked with few things. It is on the corner of Mall road and our Tempo traveller was not allowed to pass thru that mall road (even cars are not allowed after 4 PM or so) and hence we had to stop at the gandhi chowk and hire cycle rickshaws. Ok, then another problem....the hotel did not have lift from the road level and the luggage had to be carried almost 2 floors above for the reception area and there was not much help provided by the hotel staff. The rooms were very basic for the rates they charged and there was no breakfast. I suggest that you stay away from the mall road and choose hotels on the other side, which is like 5-10 mins walk from Gandhi chowk in the opposite direction of Mall road, so that your vehicles can go up to the hotel entrance and then you can walk around in the town happily..... mall road and shopping is great, the place is very scenic and especially if you like cold climate you will enjoy.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r323545928-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"205","19820703","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/9f/avatar070.jpg","205","4","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8prithvir","Prithvi R","64F4AB52215D5978F5DB601469B80640",,,,,"8prithvir",,"General Manager","660494253","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"An average hotel for a decent budget","3","2015-09","2015-10-20","We have stayed in mall palace for 2 nights. Lets me share with you the overall experience :
1. Location : Centre of mall road 
2. Food : Very Good food but service is ok and serve till 10pm though they say they serve till 10:30PM but after 10 PM if you order they show full of attitude as if they are giving food for free and favouring us 
3. Money: budget hotel but need to negotiate we have been charged 2500 for super deluxe room. In website you will get room easily at 1500 max but not sure which room hotel will give you 
4. Amenities: All basic amenities are there but on 1st day we have faced problem of hot water which ultimately wasted 1 hr of us and also hotel management where not sorry for that. 
5.

"An Average Hotel for a Decent Budget","3","2015-09","2015-09-07","Location - Its a Prime location. You don't have to walk much after taking a rickshaw from Library Point. And nearby to Mall Road too. Just infront of Ropeway.

Rooms - Rooms were big with a spectacular view of Doon Valley and Ropeway. Also they were clean and tidy. 

Food - Food was pathetic. They didn't had Tandoor. And whatever we ordered was pathetic and late. We almost had to remind them twice of an order. Tea/Coffee were very bad. 

Staff - Staff was polite. 

All in all it was an average hotel with decent tariff. If you are ready to have your meal outside or then plan your trip here!

Staff and service- The staff is too kind. Special mention to Hasan ji...made my stay very comfortable. From arranging travel to arranging dinner when I returned late, Hasan ji was very helpful and accommodating of individual needs. As a solo traveler, sa fety is very important to me and the staff made me feel really safe. 
Food - The rest of the staff as well....cafe staff is very friendly and the food is yum!! It's basic breakfast....but quality is good and fresh. 
Room-  opted for a standard basic room...but the room was fully equipped. The AC for keeping the room warm was very effective. Nights were peaceful and warm. 

Special note: I got caught in Mussoorie on a rainy day and I realised the benefits of staying a bit far from the city and truly in the valley. The views were to die for. And if you have good service available, it makes even a rainy day a good experience.

Amazing property in the hills of Mussoorie with an amazing views of Dehradun. What a beautiful property in the serene nature. And the staff is always eager to help you with your needs.

"Major room for improvement","2","2022-06","2022-06-20","We stayed at the seclude for 4 nights. The concept & location is great but the upkeep of the place is so shabby. They had 4 staff, 1 manager & 3 cooks. Only two of the staff were helpful, polite & courteous. The cooks did help us with special baby food. The rooms were cleaned everyday but overall very dirty. The rugs were dirty, the cushions torn, the dusting was very shabby. The rooms & bathrooms need a major renovation. Some of the rooms have no outlet for fresh air. The outside area to sit is lovely. We got good weather. The view from the seclude is nice. The food is so so. Nothing special but average. The kitchen was not as clean as it should be. We paid a lot for our rooms. The quality & the price was a big mismatch.

"Beautiful location and tranquility in abundance","4","2019-07","2019-07-10","The best part about the place is its location. It is away from the hustle bustle of the city and offers a beautiful view of the hills. If you are looking for peace and tranquility then this is the place for you. There are many beautiful walks that one can go on around the lodge. With hardly any people around and nature in all its glory, these walks are absolutely breathtaking and mesmerizing. I had gone with my family and we stayed here for two nights. All of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 

What also makes the stay comfortable and enjoyable is the efficient and helpful staff. All the people working at the lodge are very humble, courteous and helpful. They are not only efficient in their work but whenever I turned to them for any kind of help they were very forthcoming and responsive. So a huge thank you to them for making our stay comfortable.

The lodge has a cafe/restaurant as well. It is a relaxed,chilled out space which not only offers a range of interesting food options but also other recreational activities such as games and books for those who want to sip on their cup of favourite beverage and enjoy a good read. The cafe definitely adds to the charm of the lodge. 

The only thing that I felt required some attention was the maintenance of the place. The lodge has been done up very tastefully but the up keep of the place is lacking. For example, the floor mats in the rooms are dirty and need to be washed/changed. Also the towels in one of the rooms were very old and a little dirty. If this is looked into and improved upon then this place would actually be perfect in every sense of the term.

Overall I would say that this place is definitely worth going to. Infact I would love to visit again and maybe this time for a longer duration. Keep up the great work of running this lodge. For people like us who love in the cities it is nothing short of heaven on earth.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r688580659-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoojaD340","Pooja D","44074BCE301F6ADDFA87F7CA4BAC643C",,,,,"PoojaD340",,"Manager","698369206","en","2019-08-12","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"Majestic Palace - Memorable Stay","5","2019-06","2019-06-25","Undoubtedly Seegreen lodges is the place to be, if you want to blend with nature. The place is nestled between Mountains. A simple room with basic amenities, just enough for a cozy stay.

Before anything, must appreciate the wonderful staff with all the right information (when asked) & who also dish out delicious food - be it Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or Snacks (including hot sizzling chocolate brownie :-) 

The hike to George Everest Point in rain will stay fresh forever in our minds.

In the 4 days that we stayed, booked cab to visit Lal Tibba, Mesmerizing trek to Surkhanda Devi Temple at Dhanoulti, Kempty Falls, Mall Road & Camel Back road, Speed boating at Tehri Lake.

The adorable & friendly doggies is another reason we would remember this place forever :)

We are smitten - would definitely come back to stay again. 

Thumbs up to the Team and Place.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r684206873-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"512","404585062","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/1d/7a/66/anoopbaskaran.jpg","512","49","171","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anoopbaskaran","Anoop","90B04088AF5C0C28258CFFCA282B6F4E",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","Anoopbaskaran",,"Owner","698369110","en","2019-08-12","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"Perfect place to unwind","5","2019-05","2019-05-28","This place is for nature lovers who want to get lost in nature and unwind themselves from citi life, we ended up at this place with recommendation from our friend, on reaching there we just felt 'wow what a lovely place' although it is simple and basic but accommodation is clean food is very good, we are vegetarian jains and we had all our meals there for 3 nights 4 days and we did not find any problem or reason to complain. Owner, staff  all are so nice and warm that they go out of their way to make you comfortable and happy, although we were told that there is nothing much to do but we found lot of things to do especially short walks and treks around and visit to Lal Tibba Landor. Going for bird watching and trekking with their guide Sunil is experience of life.We stayed for a night in Loghut and 2 nights in room, we were very comfortable at both the places.Sitting on the deck and watching green forest around and mountains makes to distressed from everything.Having barbecue, pizza lemon ginger tea was pleasure.If you have your own vehicle you may explore nearby places as taxis are to be called and they are expensive.

They served us delectable food and helped organise hikes and cabs around the area. The rooms were clean, cosy and extremely comfortable. The views from the property and surrounding areas were stunning. Luckily the weather was on our side, too. And how can I forget the wonderful dogs Mowgli and Tama who kept us company throughout!

"A Hidden Gem in the mountains!","5","2019-05","2019-05-28","My friends and I stayed at the Seegreen Lodges for about 3 days. Although we were told that there isn't much to do around the area, the caretaker of the property equipped us with a lot of different activities that kept us very entertained! I want to make a special mention to Harsh and Mr. Somendar (caretaker) who took unbelievable care of every need we had. They even organise cabs for you in case you would want to go into the main town (upon request). They are very friendly and cooperative. It is also extremely safe for girls to travel. 

The guest rooms were incredibly clean. It looked extremely warm and inviting. The owners of the property have clearly paid attention to details and provided all the facilities that can ensure a comfortable stay. The best part of this property is the magnificent views. Moreover, there is a fabulous cafe right under the lodge which serves the best food.  

Honestly, its one of the best places I have stayed in the hills. Secluded from the main commotion of the town with breathtaking views. I can't wait to go back!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r677018396-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harshi20","Harshita Shroff","A4B52DDCEE67EC69433A46657C499F2D",,,,,"Harshi20",,"Owner","679139561","en","2019-06-05","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"Lovely surroundings...far from the maddening crowds","4","2019-05","2019-05-24","We stayed here in the middle of summer, yet Mussoorie gave us cool climes and stunning views. Seegreen lodges is slightly far from Mall Road, but we recommend hiring a scooter since if you, like us, prefer serene and quiet spaces. I do feel the rooms were a bit run down, but the view is lovely. The caretaker boys are very sweet and helpful, but we did feel the lack of that warm hospitable touch only a host can provide. We emphatically recommend trying out the hot aloo paranthas and lovely ginger tea made by the simple pahadi woman down the road in her small yet cosy hut. It was like a scene out of Ruskin Bond's novel...sitting outside on the hillside sipping hot tea and watching the sime hill folk gossip and go about their daily business.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r676257494-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452388669","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","1200","2","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ash1574","Ash1574","2110A62E7DC1E07E3DBF58423B5CE10A",,"255060","Sydney, Australia","Sydney","Ash1574",,"Owner","679139656","en","2019-06-05","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"pleasant stay with family","4","2021-12","2022-01-03","We stayed at the seclude mansion for about 3 days and had a very pleasant stay all throughout. We especially enjoyed the food by chef Shashi who cooked almost all cuisines for us. The food was tasty and gave a homemade feel. Apart from this, the view from the property was exceptional at all times of the day. We also enjoyed the bonfire nights that the friendly staff had set up for us. On the downside, the geyser system in a few rooms was not working and limited the ability to get hot water  easily. However, overall the property was clean and we had a pleasant stay","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d8435492-r823840899-Seclude_Mussoorie-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452389554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agarwvi","Vikram","C467C97299C5ABB6D2B42BA4789C07EF",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","agarwvi",,"Guest Services / Front Office","824620629","en","2022-01-11","Seclude Hotels","Dear Guest,

"Horrible experience","1","2015-08","2015-08-22","hello..we had stayed in hotel mall palace for just one day and let me tell you it wasn't worthy staying for more than one day.not one but many reasons for that like. 
1-no pick and drop service from anywhere in mussoorie not even from taxi stand
2-dirty rooms and below avg bed and beddings,tv,they even placed a towel in place of a doormat
3-To get wi-fi you have to go to hotel reception and he or she will connect your wi-fi not allowing yourself to do it
4-the stairs you have to climb with your baggage after a long walk of mussoorie to reach the hotel

The only good thing about this hotel is that it's nearest to ropeway

Overall it was the worst experience I had ever faced in any of my trip to anywhere so far
Never recommend to anyone","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r302330426-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","2","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madhuresht","drmadhuresh t","6557F6470CDC0349F9243C3D82184A9A",,"297684","Lucknow, India","Lucknow","madhuresht",,"Guest Relations Manager","660497713","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"The worst experience ever","1","2015-08","2015-08-11","Well readers please bear me for this essay. Going  by the reviews in tripadvisor.in where travellers praised this hotels for the scenic beauty, I made an online booking for two nights and they charged full payment in advance. When I dropped in I found the reviews of scenic beauty quite genuine. but the hotel was not unclean. It was not hygenic. And the atmosphere started giving me headache, especially the loud music outside the hotel. Within an hour when i ordered food i found the service very unimpressive and kinda bad. Therefore I immediately went out an booked rooms in Fortune Grace  Resort. When I checked out of the hotel they didnt return a single penny.I stayed in the hotel for hardly two hours. I was expecting them to to return the atleast second night's room rent. But I got nothing. The manager felt guilty and tried to convince the owner. but the owner didnt listen to him and grabbed the whole money. To my surprise, they also charged the tea tat I had in my room. Therefore, stay away from Mall Palace.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r297896595-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1024","144437445","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/9b/f0/c5/abhilash1000ika.jpg","1024","7","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abhilash1000ika","Abhilash1000ika","A0272208280C6D9DD4776593BA95B32D",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","Abhilash1000ika",,"Guest Relations Manager","660497751","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

One needs to take a rickshaw from the bus stop to reach here. There is a lift in the hotel so you wont have to climb stairs. It is also near to the Mall road. The only problem is with Monkeys.

"Good location but overpriced as per the quality of rooms and services provided","3","2015-03","2015-03-17","Hotel was under renowation and room booked by us was not good inspite of being a superior category room.
Since we got good discount from Goibibo so the prices seems to be a bit fair else the actual room tariffs were very high and rooms were not worth as per their pricing.
Moreover since the renowation and construction work was under progress which made the whole stay a bit noisy. Yet we were offered room at higher floor but still the machine noise was quite high.
Hotel location is excellent as it is located midway on the Mall road and food being prepared was also OK OK. View from the rooms was awesome and magnificient.
Staff was also good and courteous.
Overall the room tariffs were very high for the rooms and services being offered but the location of the hotel was excellent.
Probably once the renowation work gets completed, they might improvise.

3. They honestly tried to serve us better - and addressed all our inconveniences.
4. Reception is very helpful.

Towels were not clean at first time - however, they changed those with fresh cleann towels.
Food test can be improved - though quality of ingredients was good.

However, I will definitely stay at this hotel next time also - simply due to their polite, gentle and honest staffs.

"Great Hotel, Great Location, Good services...","4","2015-01","2015-01-27","Very good Hotel according to the price we paid, we stayed there two nights and three days during last week of Jan'15. Best view from the terrace of the hotel...ropeway is over the terrace....amazing view in night....can see snowfall on terrace. View from terrace was mindblowing. Rooms are also very spacious and well cleaned. Bathroom was also well cleaned and 24hrs hot water facility. TV was also working. Good behaviour of hotel staff...also in my case in early morning they specially called me to see the snowfall. Can see the the lot of monkey's and langoors on the terrance....I had enjoyed with them by giving foods, buscuits shooting photos and videos etc...Not too much far from Bus stand (Library chowk)...can walk if you don't have too much luggage. However, rikshaw is also available...If you once stay here and see the views, facility etc you will forget all disadvantage, if any... Next time i am in mussorie i will definately stay here...Totally paisa wasool...Quite satisfied and highly recommended......","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r251219789-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452388955","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","1200","2","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raj_Saharsa","Raj_Saharsa","D60AC2A5C28A52741D1AD3280162EEAA",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Raj_Saharsa",,"Guest Relations Manager","660494451","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"A very decent hotel","5","2014-12","2015-01-19","Hotel Mall Palace is a hotel in the middle of the Mall Street in Mussoorie. Location is very good, but tourist vehicles are not allowed to reach the place, so you have to walk long distance with your luggage or hire a rikshaw...One more disadvantage is that to get to the mail gate is quite hard - quite high, so if you travel with elderly people, this may be a problem, but once you reach the hotel, you will be rewarded by a great view. The hotel has got great views. At night you can see the lights of Dehradun and in the morning you can see the sunrise. Maybe noisy at weekends due to proximity to the Mall Road (loud music and shouting).
Rooms - rooms were clean, bedsheets were clean as well, towels were clean. Everything inside the hotel looks quite old, old-fashioned, but in pretty good condition. TV was working, room service was good, food was OK, tea was very tasty. No room heater in December, blankets was very warm. The hotel has got a lift :)
The only unpleasant thing was the cockcroaches in the bathroom, but India is a tropical country, so pests are everywhere...If you see them - consider them as a part of nature :))
We had rooms with balcony, so monkeys visited us several times. Be careful!!! Don't leave anything outside - they will eat or snatch.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r250118255-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"300","299925611","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/e0/80/6b/jam4ika.jpg","300","97","134","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jam4ika","Jam4ika","492ADB15C64C0D621929920BD1F73B1E",,"298484","Moscow, Russia","Moscow","Jam4ika",,"Guest Relations Manager","660494471","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Waste of time and money...","2","2014-12","2015-01-04","We visited mussourie on new Year's eve and made the biggest mistake of our lives in staying at this hotel!! Situated on the most crowded street, there is no peace around this place. 
The hotel is just a namesake hotel, with no concrete staff...the rooms are messy with dirty and torn bedcovers, bathrooms have leaking taps and adding to this there is no room heater. For heater they charge an extra 200 bucks for each night. Do not count on their wifi, as it is only available at reception, it's strength to the rooms is too feeble, next to nothing.The restaurant is almost always deserted, with no staff seen on the floor.

The only decent thing was food quality which is available at all times in your room itself. Overall, really disappointing experience.!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r247521026-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"205","19820645","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/65/avatar043.jpg","205","5","56","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanjhiVerma","SanjhiVerma","ABAA4EDB981D1AADF0D849F22DD934AF",,"644043","Noida, India","Noida","SanjhiVerma",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498725","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Room ok, Bathroom not ok!","2","2014-04","2014-12-02","This one is strictly for budget travellers who are determined to visit a dirty stinking hill station in the middle of nowhere. Having heard a lot about Massoorie and it being the only hill station in north west India I had not visited, I decided to stay overnight with my Father who wanted a three day break there while I completed an assignment in Dehradun for that duration. 

Driving across the Mall was a task as it was crowded and dirty. Parking at the hotel was tough as space in a small hill station hotel is limited anyway.

The lift were old fashion shutter type commensurate with the hotel age and quality.

We asked for a room with a view of the hills. This was the best part of the hotel. Lovely to see the clouds rolling up our hill and into the room through the windows! The room was strictly ok and basic. Small old TV, make do furniture and ordinary bed and linen. The balcony outside was a nice place to be.

The bathroom was old and a big put off. 

Room service was slow and food was ordinary. 

If you do visit Massoorie, do look for a better hotel to make the most of your visit.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r242647129-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"790","199926950","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/ea/a4/a6/aisquash.jpg","790","127","411","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aisquash","Aisquash","CF4258AF9DCCC6EE19DFC9CA0A32205F",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","Aisquash",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498768","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

The only thing which I could say that property is not in a secluded places as the name suggests.  I had been to their other property in Palampur too, which is really good and a quite peaceful place.

"Superb stay during winters","5","2021-12","2021-12-13","We stayed for 2 nights at Seclude Mussoorie. Think of going to your grandparents' place during holidays - that's how nice the staff is to you! Very courteous, and accommodating. The food is REALLY delish! Like they'll stuff you with good food all through the day! The manager, Nitin, and his team ensure that your stay is as comfortable as possible. 

We stayed in the Wooden room, which I reckon is the bigger room. The bed is heated, and quite cozy during winters. It overlooks the valley. The seating area outside is good, and you can enjoy a bon-fire in winters (paid)

The property is quite close to the Mall Road, and one can easily walk down. You can rent scooties/bikes from the vendors near the Mall Road. Landour is around 20-odd mins from the property.

My only concern is that there's no parking on the property, and one has to park on the main road. Everything else is good.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d8435492-r821954808-Seclude_Mussoorie-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,,,,,"0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohansatija","Rohan","1CA39825138D19157C60C437B1EBDC97",,,,,"rohansatija",,"Guest Services / Front Office","821962323","en","2021-12-13","Seclude Hotels","Dear Happy Guest.

Must try : BBQ & Bon fire 

Thanks to the hotel staff - Mr. Manoj , Dheeraj , Arvind  , Anish. Etc .
They were very polite ... quick .... honest and humble to talk to . 

Also special thanks  to Mr. Nitin - the property manager for making the stay wonderful overall .

"Boutique Resort with great staff and open sit out","4","2021-11","2021-11-25","Location of resort is near the entry to main Mussorie from Picture Palace side. One can easily miss the resort, needs better marking and bigger sign board.

Checkin was fast. Staff was helpful in parking of vehicles on main road, especially Manoj and Dheeraj.

Nitin was helpful during the settling down period. We stayed in Blue Room, possibly the best room in terms of view and accessibility. Room and toilet were neat and clean with all amenities.

Had a bonfire and barbeque during our stay, wonderfully arranged by the staff, especially the Chef, Shashikant, who whipped up exotic dishes during our stay, ably helped by Arvind on the Tandoor. A big thanks to the complete team of Seclude.

"Poet's Paradise","5","2021-11","2021-11-22","So, our stay at Seclude, Mussorrie was a brief one in the month of Nov'21. And oh boy, what a fabulous experience we had, on that beautifully crafted nest placed right at the top of hill. And in case you are a creative person who loves to write/think/ponder/introspect, trust me you'll surely be on your way to create your next masterpiece. Sitting with my better half, feeding on the purest form of sunlight and sipping tea on that brick laden patio placed right in the center, all of this has been an experience I'll surely remember all my life. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. I'll cite an example to give you a flavour of their seamless hospitality.

So, I needed a scooty for some personal reason to ferry some of our luggage to Mall Road to and fro multiple times. Had a tough time to arrange the same. Mr Nitin who manages the property there, offered us help and was ready to provide his scooty to me so that I can transfer my luggage. He also lent me his helmet to us for the entire day as we planned to roam Landour on a rented scooty. These gestures which are are out of way, goes a long road, building a long lasting impression into customer's mind. Then there were two other guys : Mr Anish and Mr Dhiraj, both were kind, helpful and sweet chaps. They both offered whatever help and guidance we needed on the resort including clicking our photos, explaining the itenary for our tour, arranging scooty, bringing in fruits and impeccable room service. Dhiraj and Anish, you guys are one of the strongest assets of Seclude, intangible but yet fundamentally so important. Mr Shashi Kant, you've cooked delicious meals for us, nothing out of world, but classic Indian home made food. Do try Shahi Paneer and Dal Tadka along with fluffy phulkas. Another guy Mr Manoj also helped us in our itenary planning and gave a local guys number for car renting. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Kudos to the concept!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d8435492-r819689130-Seclude_Mussoorie-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452389216","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rohan654321","Rohan","C89AD9FD7A464FA642569AD86D923C21",,,,,"Rohan654321",,"Guest Services / Front Office","821960076","en","2021-12-13","Seclude Hotels","Dear Guest.

The location is perfect for anyone looking to escape the city and enjoy the tranquility of nature.

The rooms were cozy, clean, and well-maintained, with all necessary amenities provided. The staff & the manager Hasan was incredibly warm and hospitable, always going above and beyond to ensure our comfort.

Even if you're not enticed by the mist that flows swiftly in your room while you relish the pristine surrounding of jharipani or if sitting on some 1928 model Willys as you soak the placid sunset doesn't appeal to you, the service that the staff offers is immaculate. Not once came a moment when they weren't ready to ensure that our stay was way more than a memorable experience. When our kid felt unwell, they were there with us and went to great lengths to ensure that our kid was all ok. The rooms were very clean and the vines that surround the gate of the rooms feels.simply like our of some fantasy novel. You've got to be very crude to not like the place.

"Amazing Time At The Retreat","4","2024-09","2024-09-28","It is a beautiful and quiet retreat offering stunning views of the open expanse of sky, mountains and the city below. We stayed in the Suite Room, and the scenery from the wide glass windows was absolutely breathtaking. The property is well-maintained with a cozy homestay vibe. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. The highlight was definitely the food—delicious, homely meals that felt so gratifying. A fantastic stay overall!

"Overpriced, Secluded, with Lousy Management- Not worth It","1","2024-09","2024-09-17","Overhyped, overpriced property. Photos aren't actual. Unfortunately, got to know the reality about the ""resort"" from the locals only once we reached Mussorie.
Requested them to cancel our booking, after deducting the cancellation charges. As expected, it was quite rudely turned down.
Although the staff in general is polite, the
Manager cum caretaker is on the arrogant side. A simple request to ""grill the sandwiches"" was twice coldly & abruptly turned down by the manager first by saying, ""this is the menu today"", and secondly ""we don't have a direct kitchen"" . Although the breakfast was being served from their own restaurant, located inside their property, barely 5mtrs away.
Breakfast provided was also very mediocre.
No fruits, cornflakes etc, limited 2,3 options.
Taxi to Mall Road is minimum ₹600 one way.
Rooms although clean, aren't worth 5k+. Old construction, No fridge, AC wasn't working, small as compared to similar hotel rooms available on Mall Road, Mussoorie.
By any standards it's not a ""resort"". Barely 3000 sqft in total. No badminton, volleyball, tt court etc.
Visit only if you have company, or are ok with just lazing around the whole day with extremely mediocre and overpriced food.

Hotel highlights - Great view · Quiet
Rooms are Small with shared balcony. Non functioning AC.

"The best of Mussoorie at Seegreen","5","2019-04","2019-04-29","Seegreen lodges was the highlight of our visit to Mussoorie. Located at the serene location of hathipoan, Seegreen is the perfect location for some beautiful hikes(George Everest and clouds end). The rooms are super comfy and overlooks the mountain. The Seegreen cafe located at the ground floor of the lodge serves up some of the best food. From hand tossed pizzas to their honey lemon ginger tea, everything is prepared by love and it shows up in the taste. The caretakers at the lodge are super nice and will help you with local tips to travel around the location. The lodge is located off the hustle bustle of Mall Road and landour. Seegreen let’s you be in nature and is the perfect location to refresh your senses. Finally, the owners of the lodge and cafe  go out of their way to welcome you and make your stay perfect. A lovely couple who loves the mountains and doing their bit to sustain the environment and develop the livelihoods of the local people. Do not miss the chance to experience Seegreen.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r670330359-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"450","444192730","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/79/d7/da/caption.jpg","450","7","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sujeshn16","Sujesh Nair","4FF5646E26140C5093C68D7EA2023C80",,,,,"sujeshn16",,"Owner","679140202","en","2019-06-05","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"A superb little gem","5","2019-04","2019-04-26","We stayed for four nights and our stay was truly relaxing and rewarding. The property is located well away from the bustle of Mussoorie at Hathipaon, but one can reach Mall Road, Mussoorie reasonably easily by car or even foot. The rooms are quite cosy and comfortable and the cafe serves great food. The staff is polite and helpful, and try their best to ensure that everything is just right. The highlight is of course the peaceful environment with birdsong and great walks all around. A special mention must be made about the superb ginger lemon honey tea served at the cafe which is really unmatched elsewhere in Mussoorie. We look forward to visiting again - perhaps with a few friends to again enjoy the lovely experience.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r669379218-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,,,,,"0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akumar_aa","Ashutosh Kumar","CC2EE174BCD1B55E7F82EDA29B0A9962",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","akumar_aa",,"Owner","679140230","en","2019-06-05","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

You can spend the whole day here and still not be bored. There is a library which has a wide collection of books and there is a recreation center too, for the young ones. 

The staffs were very welcoming in nature. Specially Somendra bhaiyya helped us a lot.

"Best Little Loghut in Mussoorie","5","2019-04","2019-04-25","Recently visited Seegreen Lodges and what a pleasant experience it was.
In Mussoorie but a bit far away from the hustle and bustle and right in the middle of nature with a wonderful Himalayan range view.
The Loghut that we stayed in was one cozy cottage giving an European village feeling when you stay in.
It did not look like a hotel or a rented cottage but so homely as if you own the place.
It also has a wonderful restaurant and the best part was the morning breakfast in the open in sun. And the food so delicious.
If place and location is a winner then service is plus one.
Staff is well mannered and trained. 
Simply a place where I will visit again and again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r669116222-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imehulshah","Mehul Shah","DA4EFCFDB255AEDAE754C9D9F9159837",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","imehulshah",,"Owner","679140280","en","2019-06-05","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"Amidst Nature - A serene place","5","2019-03","2019-04-03","We visited this place in the end of March with my 22 months old son and stayed in the loghut for 4 days and had an awesome experience. My son has become a huge fan of this place and I had to literally drag him out of the place as the vacation came to an end. All FIVE points to the service, property and cleanliness in the loghut. The staff was so well trained that they themselves asked me if i need something specially made for my child and trust me they gave me exactly as we needed. 
The freshness of the vegetables and pulses gave me a sense of the pure air we are in (people call it organic) and also it came to a surprise when at such a hill station you get a woodfired pizza; delicious pasta and sizzling brownie. One of the must haves is Kheer and Mutton (Red meat for non-vegetarians). 
Also if you are a traveler or want to spend some me time they have a lovely collection of books and a few games (e.g. Jhenga) which one can be with. Also a fantastic place for meditation outside the loghut. 
Lastly if you are pet lovers they have two dogs (Mowgli and Tama) who take care of the property so well that you feel secure because they are so well trained. Loghut being at a height and every night walking up to the loghut with a child felt a little scary but these pets would guide you up and make your stay even more safer. 
A BIG THANK YOU to the owners for letting us explore such a clam and quiet place. 
See you again soon.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r663631816-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452386394","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonamv481","Sonam V","CCACDFF4A05C0AE0FA920D8E00118F59",,,,,"sonamv481",,"Owner","679140345","en","2019-06-05","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"A world of its own","5","2018-12","2019-01-01","If you are looking to cherish uninterrupted mountain views, unadulterated fresh air and the sweet chirpings of birds, you are at the right place. Seegreens lodge is a world in itself that offers amazing views of both valley mountains covered in fir and deodar and the snow-peaked Himalayas. We stayed at the Log hut for 3 nights and it has been one of my best experiences till date. 
It is situated in a nice location that is away from the Mall Madness of Mussoorie but only a 15min drive from the city centre. With a discreet location, it allows you to immerse yourself in nature and forget all worries. The cafe with its cozy atmosphere offers multi-cuisine dishes and amazing hot beverages. The staff is very friendly and always up for some nice chat. But the best part was Moogli and Tama, the two mountain dogs. The Log hut is cozy with warm interiors and the fireplace adds that extra charm. All I had to do was take my book, find the perfect nook and give myself to the surroundings. It is a must-visit if you are in Mussoorie.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r642962345-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"50","245010403","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/9a/8f/e3/titash481.jpg","50","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/titashr","titash","C3EC28724D51F35CED9ACBADB6C28963",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","titashr",,"Front Office Manager","644192121","en","2019-01-06","VickyL118","Hi Titash,

"Closest you can get to heaven❤️","5","2018-05","2018-11-22","After all the places I have visited, I can confidently say that my stay here was the most memorable of all. Everything there exceeded my expectations. Nowhere else would you find such a genuine workforce, such cleanliness and service. Even after a 3 night stay, I did not get bored of the food. Since they make everything fresh, it takes time to arrive; but that's not a problem because they have loads of games, books and music to keep you busy and in the mood. You can also go out for treks - we went thrice and never did we repeat the same track. The lodge is just a trek away from George Everest's house and cloud's end. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r635134607-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee39681986586","Sightsee39681986586","0819BB1EC001EEE248B9561F2C02AA2E",,,,,"Sightsee39681986586",,"Owner","638483092","en","2018-12-09","VickyL118","Thank you for such an apt review and seegreen looks forward to seeing you again","Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"
"Great place in the mountains","5","2018-11","2018-11-13","If you want a quiet, relaxing mountain holiday where you sit and enjoy the view in the mornings while drinking hot masala chai, go for long mountain / forest walks, come back to hot tasty food and enjoy the stars at night, then this is the place.

This is far enough from Mussoorie that it doesn't feel like a crazy, crowded Indian hill station yet close enough that you can drive to Mussoorie town proper in 10-15 minutes.

1. Great staff, they go out of their way to provide you with all the amenities. Specially want to mention Subhender and Ramesh.
2. Good fresh food. Especially try the vegetables they've grown in their own vegetable gardens.
3. The log hut is very well maintained and has a quiet patio where you can sit and enjoy the mornings and the evenings.
4. Amazing mountain walks starting from the property (to cloud end, to George Everest house, to bird sanctuary)
5. Lovely dogs - Tama and Mowgli :)

Tip:
Go for the log hut over the rooms - better views during the day as you get to sit in a quiet, small patio.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r633117208-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"205","19820689","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/91/avatar017.jpg","205","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiratC1","Kirat C","1A833BDFE1075A0E6A7ACAF7ADD58DF7",,"155019","Toronto, Canada","Toronto","KiratC1",,"Front Office Manager","634753434","en","2018-11-20","VickyL118","Hi,

"A new favourite!","5","2018-09","2018-11-12","This was one of our very best holidays. It's not often that you find a B&B that ticks all the boxes: Great -- location, lodgings, food, and hospitality. See Green is a beautiful, tranquil place removed from the bustle of Mussoorie town. We stayed in a log cabin, steps away, yet out of view of their cafe and rooms. We felt like Thoreau, camping at Walden. From the bed, we had a grand view of the pine forest and hills, perfectly framed by a large window. Our kids claimed the loft, settling in comfortably with their books and belongings on the comfortable futon upstairs. Although outwardly rustic, the cabin was fitted with creature comforts, including a water kettle and geyser. The bathroom was not unlike that in any small hotel. Mornings, we sat on the small patio and read or spotted birds. Nights we gazed at clear skies and spotted constellations. We went on long walks through the forest, one of which led us to the house of George Everest, Surveyor General of India. After hours of walking, we looked forward to returning to a hot meal at See Green, which has a modest but delicious menu of Indian and continental food. The proprietors, Vicky and Ameesha, who visit on and off, welcome you like family. They make sure you want for nothing. We had a lovely time talking to them about the history of the area and noted their recommendations on places to visit. You don't have to bring books along; their library is small but varied, from old issues of National Geographic, Duckbill books and Western classics for kids, David Baldacci...you get the drift. Can't wait to come back.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r632841029-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452388955","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","1200","1","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeannarebello","joeanna r","7C5BA7F8842C767EA81690E8B0EFEFE8",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","joeannarebello",,"Front Office Manager","634753390","en","2018-11-20","VickyL118","Hi,

"A getaway amidst nature","5","2018-10","2018-11-01","We all city dwellers come to a point in time where you want to be amidst nature yet away from the humdrum while on a holiday.. Our search for the above steered us to Seegreen lodges. The drive from Jolly grant airport wasn't the best considering the number of bends in the road and an infant who pretty much threw up all the way, but this homestay tucked away from mussoorie yet in mussoorie made up for it all.. 

We pretty much didn't venture into mussoorie except for visiting cambride book store as the nature trails around the homestay were sufficient to keep us busy for 4 days..

Don't expect luxury at the homestay. This isn't even the right place to expect that.. Simple rustic and cosy comfortable rooms are what makes Seegreen lodges themselves.. 

We had dinner on all days at the homestay and the food prepared is fresh and delicious.. We even bought a pahadi sabzi from the market which the chef gladly made for us.. I absolutely loved the green chutney and even tried asking the chef about how he makes his version... Totally did not succeed in my mission!

Loved this homestay and hoping to revisit it again for sure..","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r630042447-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"683","202559273","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/12/cf/29/travellertrail6.jpg","683","51","280","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellertrail6","travellertrail6","19DDE8183DF906402BEB08E4AC8ABD68",,"295424","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dubai","travellertrail6",,"Front Office Manager","630729546","en","2018-11-04","VickyL118","Hi,

"A perfect hideway","5","2018-07","2018-10-25","This time my hideout was Seegreen Lodges , A hidden hut surrounded by misty mountains and pines. Tastefully done rooms, and intelligent choice to have no WiFi here. Life.Smile.Bliss one in one.

Tucked in a quiet corner in Hathipaon is this quaint cafe filled with much warmth. A sign board on the way mentioned "" free tea tasting"" which caught my attention and I had to hop inside. After happily having filled with my tummy with Adrak chai and. Chicken pizza I happen to exchange glance with a lady and she happened to be none other than the owner. The menu sees some nicely done pizza, few dishes from Indian menu and drinks.

Run by Sanjeev and his wife Amisha this happy couple takes their break from City life and prefer to sip their hot cuppa here.

"Nice place but not good service","3","2018-10","2018-10-24","I am writing this review hoping it reaches the owner. I stayed at this property for 2 nights from 23rd and 24th Oct, 2018. Of course I chose this place looking at the excellent reviews across most of the websites. However, below is what I feel about this place:

Location: Superb; quite and pristine
Food: Great (the daal and mix veg was awesome)
Cottage: This is where I stayed in. The moment I entered the cottage, I could sniff the lack of cleanliness. The place was covered in dust and there was a strange smell emanating from the place. The inside design of the cottage is cozy and cute but the attention to cleanliness clearly showed the indifference of the staff in maintaining the property. We were welcomed by a giant spider too the moment we opened the bathroom cupboard. The curtains were all stained. You don't expect these when you are paying 10K for 2 nights in a hill station. We didn't use the towel since we were not sure whether they were clean too. So 0 marks for the 'inside of cottage'

Staff: Its strange to see so many good reviews about them but frankly speaking, I doubt those reviews. The staff might be good as they were from the hills but in my stay over the 2 days, I never saw them smiling. They were never rude but that sense of welcoming was never there. Maybe, they lack the training to make people feel happy about coming and staying there.  They were also careless about certain things like they never cleaned our rooms. Once we had asked them to do but they never bothered to check once if the rooms need to be cleaned. On the first night, a bottle of ketchup fell and broke near the seating area outside the cottage; it was never cleaned even when we were checking out. The complimentary omelette that was served in the morning breakfast was without any onions and tomato.When checked, the guy said that what I was asking was masala omelette and its not a part of the package. Seriously???? So in all, the lack of training was clearly visible.Had the owner been there, I would have asked for a refund. Frankly 10 K for this place doesn't seem to be worth. This place can be made so much nicer since its located at such a superb place. So, not a great experience 

Thanks
Navin

This was the last one on our list - and met all of our considerations.  Price was exceptionally good as we were there just prior to their busy season, which was to start around middle of May 2014.  We got two rooms on the third floor which had a private balcony.  Nice view of the valley during the day, and good view of lights from the town below - Dehradun.  Cars on Mall road are limited to private vehicles, and that too at certain times only.  We had to take rickshaw to get our luggage over to the hotel.  We enjoyed hotel meals as well as in this small town. Cup of tea - only a phone call away and is served in your room within minutes.  Hot water / cleanliness / nice view / friendly and helpful staff / - overall this was a nice small holiday.  Thanks to hotel staff, and all the help.

"Great location, spacious rooms, good food and helful staff","4","2014-05","2014-05-20","I stayed in Hotel Mall Palace, Mussorie on 14th May for two days.  Location of this Hotel is really great, just opposite to Ropeway, which is central place in Mussorie.  The rooms are also very spacious and the added attraction is the lift, otherwise, it would have been very difficult to climb to 4th floor from the ground floor, which itself is about 30-40 stairs above the Mall Road.  The food provided was very good and the staff of the Hotel was  also very helpful, particularly, Mr. Sanjay, the manager of the Hotel.  The view from the room is very scenic and one can see whole valley view from the room. One thing I would like to refer about tariff which should be reasonable, it seems to be overpriced.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r206293909-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452388139","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","1200","3","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sureshkathuria","sureshkathuria","C2D34983BA8913C36B36E6547CF7DACF",,,,,"sureshkathuria",,"Guest Relations Manager","660497950","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Excellent cosy stay!","5","2021-10","2021-10-16","For an honest review, I have many pros and very few cons. Here goes:
Pros:
- Unbelievable Scenic views. The sunset view from this property is to die for
- Excellent service. They are extremely accommodating and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and happy. We reached late the first evening, and they managed to keep our food ready and warm, even past the time they serve meals as per their policies. We really appreciated this gesture!
- Vibrant rooms. The rooms are very colorful (we stayed at the purple rain), and there was plenty of sunlight and beautiful views even from our room. The room was extremely spacious too with tons of cubby holes to stock your luggage and knick knacks
- Delicious food. I never felt like I was miles away from home, or from the best tasting dishes back in my hometown. Their food tastes so good, I was instantly in love. As part of their amazing service, they also made sure to make our food non spicy as we'd asked for.

Cons:
- Steep uphill walking climb to get to the property. Expect a steep climb for a bit where you will be bound to take a break to catch your breath midway, from where the cars are parked, to reach up to the property. That said, their staff is extremely helpful in carrying your luggage upstairs with them so you don't need to chug that along.
- Limited parking. The parking here is on the street, but is safe as we were told. However we did get a parking ticket during the peak traffic. However despite this, the hotel manager extended to cover for the ticket cost and got us a better parking spot. As before, excellent service.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d8435492-r814726028-Seclude_Mussoorie-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391608","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gautamgoswami1991","Gautam G","E2A4EBABA2F62EFF2F49D8B36BA60FE6",,,,,"gautamgoswami1991",,"Guest Services / Front Office","814982559","en","2021-10-18","Seclude Hotels","Thankyou so much  for your lovely feedback.

Out stay was memorable, and we want to return soon, perhaps for a longer period of time.

The staff makes you feel right at home, and the location is priceless. The restaurants are beautifully ambient, and the people there are incredibly friendly. During our stay, we met some fellow guests who were so warm and welcoming that it felt like we had known them forever. This place is definitely worth it.

Went alone. I waited for a long time to have a great trip that would really help me get back to my roots and recover my aura which would really help me to recover my motivation and gain confidence.

The place is one hell of a gem. The caretakers are very well behaved. They really take personal care. I booked for Loghut-, a European built cottage. I have as really amazed at the architecture, amenities and cleanliness.

I would really recommend this place to people who are looking for a secluded yet fantastic place with a great scenic beauty.

George Everest point, wishing well, clouds end and other brilliant bird watching trails are all within walking distance. The food served at the cafe is tasty and reminds you of home cooking.

We loved everything about this place- starting from the food and hospitality to walk to George Everest's house to the walk towards cloud's end. We enjoyed evening coffee and snacks in the small roadside shop. We were absolutely in love with the view from the common balcony outside our room and the balcony attached to their cafe. We adored the interior of the cafe, the details in decorating the room (I personally admired the effort they put in finding very cutely designed hooks for behind doors) and the bathroom. The room was very cozy and clean. 

In short, an amazing place to stay. I visited My twice before, but this was, hands down, the best place to stay - view-wise and stay wise.

Blissful stay surrounded by several nature trails to explore. View from our cosy loghut room were mountains always partly covered in fog. Extremely safe place, friendly and helpful caretaker Somendar and superb food by Gudweer....from parathas to pizzas to roti-subzi to waffle. Their cafe has a serene and welcoming ambience where you can spend hours reading from their book library or listening to music or playing games from their game collection sipping on their best ginger honey lemon tea.

The comfortable room, the charming café, and the polite staff together take care of your temporal wants, leaving you free to indulge your soul.

"Stay amidst nature's lap","5","2018-07","2018-07-20","Seegreen lodge was recommended by my colleague when I was planning short trip to Mussoorie with my wife. The moment I steped out of my car I realized that I have taken a right decision by following my friend's advice. The place is strategically located just 10 to 15 minutes before Mussoorie away from the maddening crowd. We both are nature lover and this place was aptly surrounded by lush green mountains and clouds. The view was great from the  balcony and we had very calm, peaceful and pleasant stay. This place is also blessed with indigenous super cool cafe with a notification board that ""you are entering a stress free zone"". The ambience of cafe was really a stress buster in its true sense. The cafe is really nice and blessed with wonderful staff who will serve you mouth watering dishes as per your wishes with a pleasant smile.  Complimentary breakfast was served there. Honey Lemon Ginger tea was my favourite. A must place to stay who enjoys nature away from city hustle bustle.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r597935349-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452388731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrashantK1572","Prashant K","CFEC4B525E7EE50E6A1DDF6399DF7109",,,,,"PrashantK1572",,"Owner","681124092","en","2019-06-12","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

Talking about the cafe which is the main attraction for the tourists, its very cozy but the seating for a family of 4 and above is very uncomfortable, not only this they have limited food options and their veg options are terrible, though non veg is good. we had chocolate waffle  please don't try it, its waste of money. Shahi paneer was hopeless, their garlic toast was reasonable but pathetic. In non veg we had fried chicken, chili honey chicken, chicken soup, all of the non veg items were okay. Also they don't have tandoori rotis which is a drawback as in breakfast u will get tawa prantha which was average. Their omlete was good.

"Memorable Stay","5","2018-06","2018-06-26","My friend and I stayed at SeeGreen Lodges for 5 days. It's surrounded by hills and offers a great view. It is much quieter here compared to the town. Early mornings are especially beautiful. We (both women) felt safe going on treks to Cloud End, Wishing Well and Sir George Everest view points. We even walked all the way to the Mall Road in Mussoorie.

The room interior is tastefully done and the size is good enough for 2 people. The room was cleaned on alternate days but It would have been nice if the room was cleaned everyday during our stay.

The ambience of the cafe and the food served is great. On request the chef even prepared and packed Kulith parathas for us for our trek. We loved the parathas and my friend even bought Kulith daal from there.

Dog lovers would love the two dogs at the lodge - Tamba and Mougli. Five days felt too short. I totally recommend this lodge to anyone going to Mussoorie. And a special thanks to the staff at the lodge. They were friendly, polite and always ready to help.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r591057615-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"450","31969003","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e7/ce/eb/agarwala.jpg","337","6","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgarwalA","AgarwalA","146D476BC77A9B7BACBDB0A3FF7AC837",,"297596","Chandigarh, India","Chandigarh","AgarwalA",,"Owner","681124158","en","2019-06-12","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"Fraud Hotel","1","2020-11","2020-12-30","Fraud fraud fraud. Earlier this hotel had published everywhere that it's 5 star. It's not even 0 star or it's -5 star. Staff arrogant, says bfast will be late as time changes whenever we wish, notice board timing of bfast is wrong and it's just like that. Nails are coming out of floor, one even pricked us. Rooms are stinging, no sanitization, no place for car to reach hotel, only walking is an option and old people may die of going out of breath to reach the hotel, when complaining they will not pick phone. Ultimately we had to checkout of hotel and book Itc for our stay, and as the name suggests Itc is Itc which gives best service. My advice never book this hotel as it will give u disappointment for free after your stay. No board of hotel, no service, no support. 

There staff asks us where to keep tea, we asked him u tell as there was no side table even to keep tea ordered by us. Electric kettle provided but no place to plug it for power supply, I guess it's for show piece only. 

Worst ever stay of my life, pathetic hotel or room.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d8435492-r780226629-Seclude_Mussoorie-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452388731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","0","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SAI_Shivam9","SAI Shivam Goel","EFD08BEF2294B181633FF00CE3891C76",,"297684","Lucknow, India","Lucknow","SAI_Shivam9",,,,,,,,"Picture Palace Road Westonal Cottage, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Picture Palace Road","Westonal Cottage","8435492","30.45211","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.084854","Seclude Mussoorie","462","4.5","21","12","9","90","330","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d8435492-Reviews-Seclude_Mussoorie-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","https://seclude.in/mussoorie/"

"Average hotel","3","2013-12","2013-12-28","Stayed with family in December 2013 for two days. Very poor on cleanliness especially in bathroom/toilets,leakage in bathroom/toilet taps and cistern. Bathtub color has turned from white to pale which shows that there is laxity in maintenance.There has been a seepage in room's wall due to which wall's paint has peeled off. It looks like curtain does not get changed/washed as their color has turned to black.Staff is kind of so-so.Situated at centre of mall road, it provides access to the entire mall road. One can easily walk both the ends. Rooms are spacious.Did not have courage to try their restaurant after reading older reviews. Hotel management is very sad in maintenance of hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r188861673-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391513","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg","1200","2","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814guest","814guest","3E078B6C99686BC3F1CFCCCBCA469A81",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","814guest",,"Guest Relations Manager","660494827","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Better Avoid it","1","2013-05","2013-05-29","I believe that if the management of the hotel is good and professional, the same reflection you will see at all levels. Mr. Sanjay who is the owner of the hotel is unprofessional and uncooperative. His only aim is to extract money from the customers without giving good service to the customers. Most of the reviews posted here are by first time reviewer which I believe is not genuine. The location of the hotel and property is good. All the other things like service, food, professionalism of staff is terrible. I reported all this issues to Mr. Sanjay in a humble way, but he seems uninterested. If you are looking for a hotel at similar or less price, try Hotel Vishnu Palace. I would strongly recommend avoiding Hotel Mall Palace.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r162248488-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1944","60705380","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/9e/4a/64/adventurer-leo.jpg","2592","150","24","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADVENTURER_LEO","ADVENTURER_LEO","1ABC615307805AC2F23E4BFBBF71A7F1",,"644043","Noida, India","Noida","ADVENTURER_LEO",,"General Manager","660494953","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Pathetic","1","2013-04","2013-05-09","Friends after reading about my horrible experience in this hotel m sure u will avoid it for ur best..
We had booked the room some 2 months in advance mentioning time n again that we r a family of 3 n my mum had recently had a surgery so the convenience shud b gud.they kept on saying ""YES SIR...dont wry it wil b absolutely comfortable.""
jst a wk b4 our trip they suddenly changed dre words saying since u'll reach after 6pm...dis area has restricted access to vehicles n thus u'll have to tk a ricksaw to reach the hotel..mentioning the fact that if we cancel the booking at this stage,we wl hardly have any refunds.
I asked Mr.Sanjay that is it restricted all the time or is dre ny time limits coz we nid a cab for the sight seeing,shopping etc
He promptly replied no Mam the permit is only restricted aftr 5 or 6 pm so u wont face ny problem..We believed them....n that was foolish on our part to trust his words..

On reaching the hotel which was not at all a comfortable journey from mall road with temp dropping to 12 -13 degrees...n sitting in the ricksaw for some 30 mins...we found dre staff...who were cordial enuf.,giving us various options for the room.
we chose a valley facing room instd of the terrace room as the latter lacked privacy for families...giving a common terrace..

had our dinner n rested for the nite.the 1st shock was to know that the geyser dsnt function properly in all the rooms.u r lucky if u get the hot water supply properly..else its ur luck to suffer in that cold weather as they have an instant geyser connection..u'll get hot water after some one n a half hrs...so that was a great thing to know...
From midnight we suffered of food poisoning!!! Gosh ...!! but thankfully we carried medicine with us.so got alright  in the morning..

it was cold enuf for us to order tea n some light snacks...n as soon as we had that..we agn started having vomiting..we understood that its best to avoid the food dre as the hospital was nowhr nearby..

The next day we hoped to get a cab from them so that the sight seeing cud b done...on calling up the reception a lady responded quite rudely that we dont have  any cab facility nor can we arrange any vehicle for ur sight seeing.u nid to tk a ricksaw, (paying 40/- each person each time)go to mall road n from dre hire a cab urself.we r not responsible for ur sight seeing!!!!!!!!!!!! Else u shud hv booked a cab from dehradun n came here .keep the car in our parking for as long as u stay n then move around freely by ur personal cab.
 wasnt that pathetic to know for those who had repeatedly asked before coming regarding the transportation to know that they cared least for the sight seeing or our comfort..is it the way they shud behave with tourists..???when they knew that we were coming dre from far off ..atlst they cud hv told us clearly on getting the cab from dehradun...how can ppl who r going there for the 1st time wud know that a so called PALACE dsnt even have a cab facility of dre own..!!!.We clearly understood that it was completely our fault to book with them ..

They messed up our stay,were highly uncooperative n provided the fact that restaurants r a little far off they charge hefty for the food...n that too a food which will surely make u fall sick..

I will never recommend anyone to go for this hotel Mall Palace if she/he wants to have a comfortable n pleasurable trip to mussoorie..","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r160146305-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452389009","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1200","7","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shreya673","shreya673","E27EE6F415A6496F450713175E5ABCC1",,,,,"shreya673",,"General Manager","660495128","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"An excellent experience- mall palace","5","2013-04","2013-05-03","excellent interiors.. brilliant view and awesome location and very good service.. overall the stay in Mall palace exceeded my expectations.. Food is best avoided(based on numerous teas and one meal I ordered. Also there are many brilliant options available outside).
The best thing about this hotel is its location. It is right in the middle of mall road and hence very convenient for the people who want to just take leisure walk on mall road.
The staff was very polite and helpful. They even arranged for a cab, were flexible in checkout time and also happily agreed to keep our luggage till we left mussoorie.. The room service was very good except the food which can be avoided(Do try cafe Kalsang nearby for excellent chinese/tibetian cusine). Also there are good road side places which offer very good Rajma/rice..a local speciality.
View is amazing. If you take Delux terrace option you can use the big terrace which is riht under the ropeway and also you can see a very good view of Deharadun while sipping tea from your terrace.
Overall an excellent experince. I plan to go to to mussoorie again and if I do, hotel Mall Palace would be my choice. no doubt.

"Good hotel, good location, excellent view, though quite 'un'peaceful","4","2013-03","2013-04-07","Its a good hotel, with an excellent view of the doon valley. The rooms are comfortable and clean. We stayed in deluxe suite- balcony and would suggest the same to all travelers, as the balconies open onto a breathtaking view of the doon valley as well as provide you that personal space. The room service is very good, the housekeeping even better. Errands are done within minutes and the waiters and attendees take delight in helping the guests. The reception is okay, not very helpful though. The one big drawback of the hotel we experienced was that of crowd control, meantersay that the guests who occupied the terrace rooms very very loud mouthed and uttered expletives whilst talking amongst themselves as well as drank liquor right there on the terrace (in broad daylight needless to say then, in the night too). It was embarrassing and very very disturbing. And the worse part was that upon asking them thrice and further requesting the reception staff and subsequently the hotel manager, nothing was done to ask those guests to maintain the decorum. On the contrary, a blame was shot back that its the festive season so the expletives are common, upon which i wonder, how many of us utter abuses upon ourselves during festivals. Hence, due to this incapability of the hotel administrative staff to deal with situations like this (which i call crowd control), i would suggest families to avoid this hotel.
Summarising, the hotel is good, the view from the hotel (esp. balcony rooms) is breath-taking, the room service and housekeeping is excellent and the location very good, however the ambience is that of chaos and hence not peaceful at all..","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r156852936-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1284","61960552","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/b1/71/68/zeeshan-s.jpg","1164","55","132","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZeeshanS311","Zeeshan Shakil","7DF747E0334B36F5E86578BD16BD40A6",,"297684","Lucknow, India","Lucknow","ZeeshanS311",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498545","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"A very Good hotel to stay in mussoorie","4","2013-03","2013-04-01","It was my first trip to mussoorie, as mentioned,  the Hotel is located right in the middle of the Mall Road. I stayed in the super Dlx room, Doon valley view from the window was great, Good food, friendly staff, good for family and couples. If you are travelling for the first time then take Bus from Dehradun to Library end in Mussoorie. From library end you can take a Cycle rickshaw to the Hotel.

"AVERAGE","3","2013-03","2013-04-01","here are some good and bad points of the hotel -:
good points -:
1) hotel is at good location very near the mall road market
2) opposite to the the hotel you will get the rope way to gun hill
bad points -:
1) i left the balcony door open and a monkey came inside the room and made mess, there was no one on the floor to listen .
2) the receptionist upgraded the room without prior information and were asking for extra charge though when we refused they never took it.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r156216739-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452388586","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","1200","15","25","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doodle27","doodle27","242FDAFB8B99BB8253B06BA84398EF9C",,,,,"doodle27",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498570","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Centrally located hotel with nice view of Doon Valley","4","2013-01","2013-03-19","I along with my 2 friends planned a weekend trip to Mussourie from Noida. Since I have never driven in hilly areas so felt safe to park my car at Dehradun railway station, paid 70 RS for 24 hours parking and board a bus bound to mussourie which charged us 41 RS per head. You can get bus to mussourie from dehradun railway station itself. 
We reached there in around 1 hour and headed straight to Hotel Mall Palace which had been just like my family hotel for last 31 years. When I was on way to mussourie from dehradun My father told me over phone that he and my mother stayed at this centrally located hotel facing the ropeway and Doon valley in 1982 when they were in mussourie on their honeymoon. That time it was a newly built hotel which had tariff of 32 RS. He always make a point to stay in this hotel whenever he is in mussourie. Seeing this hotel, I also recalled our several summer vacations to mussourie in my younger days, I had been to mussourie thrice before but all the trips were almost 10 years back.
Now coming on to hotel, you can choose from room ranging from deluxe @ 2000 rs, deluxe terrace@ 3200, deluxe balcony @3400, luxury with bathtub@ 3600, 3 bed suite@ 4000 to 4 bed suite@ 4400. These are the rates for May June and July which is peak season, otherwise there is flat discount of 50%. This hotel is very close to camels back road and Appu Ghar. You can easily get a paddle rickshaw in front of hotel to visit nearby places.
The 4 bedded suite in which we stayed was a quite nice with private terrace from which one can have pleasant view of Doon Valley which in night looks like cluster of twinkling stars. All rooms are equipped with LCD (but who cares when on a trip to hill station, we didn't saw any thing except news for few minutes), room and toilet were clean and room service was good. Prefer rooms on higher floors as they have balcony and private terrace for view of valley.

"Feels like I am living in Heaven","5","2018-06","2018-06-10","I generally don't give reviews, but this place deserves one. It helps me to found what i am actually.
 
I visit Mussoorie last week with my husband and stayed at Seegreen Logdes. The place was awesome with wooden based ambiance. It's just 4 kms from Mall Road and sits in nature arms. The view from inside and specially outside the room can filled your heart with peace and happiness. The cool air and fantastic view of mountains with birds voice will make to you to forget all your worries, anger and other problems. 

Other thing which refresh your mind was the cafe located downstairs only. It was decorated beautifully and in artistic manner. If you are book lovers, then It have a small library too inside cafe . The sitting area inside and outside the cafe was excellent with sofas , bean bags and chairs. The food and beverages was delicious, specially the Pizza and Lemon Honey Ginger Tea.

You can also ask the staff to play the music of your choice and enjoy having dinner or lunch with your partner. The nature will add more love to it.

You can enjoy trekking too and visit George Everest and Wishing Well located nearby Lodge and famous destination in Mussoorie.

You can easily reach to Seegreen Lodge with cab, even the manager there will arrange cab too if you wan't. Siddharth who manages cafe and logde is a great person and always have a smile on his face :) . He takes care of your every need and guide you well. The other staff members were also very nice.

I love to stay at Seegreen again and recommends the same to others.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r586344005-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391289","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prabhjeet29","Prabhjeet29","89AEACE3E22BE59A8CF90FED0678EBE4",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","Prabhjeet29",,"Owner","681124193","en","2019-06-12","VickyL118","Dear Guest,

"Home away from home in nature's lap ","5","2018-05","2018-05-16","Didn't know that such a place exist within Mussoorie. The location is superb, at the junction of cloud's end, wishing well, George everest point and mall road. The rooms pro ode views that makes one feel right in the middle of  hills and trees, to add to it the rooms have a nice pine wood interior that makes the room feel very cosy. Sit outs add to this experience. The common Cafe serves finger licking food with a very warm and courteous staff. The chef prepared tandoori chicken on demand and it was nothing like what I ever had back in Gurgaon. Siddharth, who manages the cafe and lodge, adds a very vibrant and youthful energy through his choice of music and his warm smile. The cafe has a nice collection of books and games to keep visitors engaged. Last, but no the least, we had the good fortune of bumping into the lodge's owners, Sanjeev and Ameesha, who felt like family/friends we were meeting in a home away from home. Very memorable stay - truly loved it!!!

"Love Nature and hiking... Best place in Mussoorie","5","2018-05","2018-05-16","Seegreen Lodge is an excellent getaway and an ideal place for nature enthusiasts. One can take long leisurely walks around the place or can hike to george everest peak or cloudend place. This place is away from the Mussoorie town and hence is peaceful and quite throughout the day. The rooms are just right for a small family and intelligently decorated. A lot of place outside the rooms so that you and your friends can sit in the evening and can have fun.

Another thing that stands out about Seegreen Lodge is the food. They prepare some lip-smacking, delicious meals. The staff is pleasant and helpful. The dining area is comfortable and nicely decorated. I guess they are fan of chumbak... Owl decoration everywhere. A north indian will really love the food they prepare. They got some nice shakes.

Siddharth (manager) who is also quite enthusiastic and is a lover of nature, took all the guests on short nature walks near by to all the places. He makes our stay worth too. He looked after our needs and was there all the time.

We had immense fun staying at Seegreen Lodge. Definitely worth a second visit.

"Wild, Comfortable and Serene.. Excellent is an understatement","4","2018-05","2018-05-08","Seegreen Lodge is an excellent getaway and an ideal place for nature enthusiasts. One can take long leisurely walks around the place or can choose to retire himself or herself at the lodge and listen to the bird songs. This place is away from the Mussoorie town and hence is peaceful and quite throughout the day. The rooms are just right for a small family and intelligently decorated. The lodge gives a feeling of an hunters lodge and is an all wood property. 

Another thing that stands out about Seegreen Lodge is the food. They prepare some lip-smacking, delicious meals. The Honey-Ginger Lemon tea is a must have. The staff is pleasant and helpful. The dining area is comfortable and nicely decorated. 

Being close to the nature, I would recommend an in-house naturalist, who can take the guests on short nature walks and help them spot different birds that flock this place.

We had immense fun staying at Seegreen Lodge. Definitely worth a second visit.

"Small property, great stay","5","2018-04","2018-04-30","This is a small property away from the city. Although it is right on the road, but it is a back road into Mussourie and hence there is no traffic. Once you take a left turn after Bhatta Village, its an amazing drive to the property. We were on a bike and thoroughly enjoyed this scenic drive. Once we reached, the checking-in was a breeze. The room was cute. All wooden everywhere, very thoughtful touches like emergency light in the bathroom in case of a electricity failure, very cute cloth hangers behind the doors, etc. The room though on the small side, are very well lighted and have a great view. Staff is quite helpful. They cook great food. One thing that stands out for me from their menu is the masala papad. I have not had the likes of it anywhere.

"BEAUTIFUL cottage- nice view and staff","5","2018-03","2018-04-25","This place has a lovely wooden chalet like a swiss cottage- it smells of wonderful pine and deodar wood. My family and I had great time here- on the last day it rained which was thoroughly enjoyable from the comfort of the cottage, sipping a ginger lemon honey and looking at the clouds below us.

Food tips: try the mandwa roti, it's quite a nice change from the usual rotis and goes well with chicken and dal. The cook's Chinese is also good and so is the pizza. Although the chocolate mousse was a little thick for my liking. 

Room tip: Take the cottage or room number 3

"Going to Mussoorie and love nature? Look no further!","5","2018-01","2018-03-09","I lived at Seegreen during my trip to Mussoorie in January this year. I loved the place! Staying in Seegreen allows you to be in nature, away from the maddening crowds, yet just 4KM from the town. It is also perfectly located to take a morning trail to Benog Wildlife Sanctuary and is on the way to George Everest Point - a popular destination.

The rooms are clean and spacious, yet have a cozy feel to them. The bathrooms are absolutely clean as well. All of my requests were taken care of with a smile by the staff.

Food was never an issue as the cafe serves delicious food. It's where I ended up having all but one of my meals. Doesn't get much better than starting your day with aloo paratha and coffee on a cold winter morning while birding right from the cafe.

I would highly recommend Seegreen for anyone visiting Mussoorie who wants some peace and quiet without burning a hole in their pocket!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r565441674-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","6","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pugdandee","pugdandee","98CF91F0A3D3992861E864CCD65D2D3E",,,,,"pugdandee",,"Owner","568459036","en","2018-03-24","VickyL118","Thanks for the 5 stars ","Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"
"Great Location ! Good for 1st timers.","3","2012-12","2013-02-20","Went there in December 2012. The hotel is very ideally located ,close to the ropeway and the Mall Road. You would be at just the right place in Mussorie if you stay here(1st timers should prefer).

Dint try the food. Service is not bad. Parking is a bit of a headache but I suppose that's expected when hotels are made on uneven hillocks facing the valley.

View is really good of the valley and the Mall Road. 
If you have been to Mussorie before and explored most of it, then I suggest you stay at a better hotel. This is good for first timers and good enough to keep luggage and explore the place and crash at night after dinner,evening stroll.

Slightly overpriced as a package.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r152615936-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"2048","92071566","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/7c/e6/8e/anish-barjatya.jpg","863","59","243","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anish_Barjatya","Anish_Barjatya","898CEC76EF2A99C69FAFB8E127FAF12D",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Anish_Barjatya",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498609","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Great Hotel at a good price","4","2012-11","2012-12-26","It was our first visit to Mussorie, after reaching dehradun, we didn't take a bus which would have been very cheap but bit uncomfortable but we took a taxi instead which charges Rs100/person on sharing and Rs500 for taxi if you want to hire. The Taxi dropped us at the starting of mall Road and then it was a tiring journey for about 1km to the hotel(will recommend you to ask the taxi guy to drop you to garhwal Mandal taxi stand as from there you have cycle rickshaws to take you to the hotel and would be helpful to old people or even people tired of sick of hill journey). Hotel is clean decent with balcony facing the Hills and ropeway(right across the road) but luckily there wasn't much noise because of that. Room service food is OK at best, so it would be better if you try restaurants outside on mall road. Breakfast was OK. Room has a quilt to keep you warm from outside chill. In Off season you can get greatttt discounts i got a rate of 1300/night in the beginning of November. 

One advise, keep your doors and windows closed as there are a few monkeys nearby who can come to your balcony if they see somebody. Overall good place to stay as it is the centre of Mall road opposite the ropeway to Gunhill.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r148074664-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,,,,,"14","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rock12316","rock12316","C8874676D571EAE5C632EA356AD0B212",,"304555","Jaipur, India","Jaipur","rock12316",,"Guest Relations Manager","660495205","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Nice Stay and Wonderful Experience","4","2012-10","2012-10-22","After analyzing lots of hotel thru Tripadvisor finally I decided to choose Mall Palace Hotel based on reviews posted here. I found these reviews very helpful and after my visit I am posting my review as below with pics:

I stayed in Mall Palace Hotel with my wife, opposite to Ropeway on Mall Road, Near Jhulaghar for 4 nights in Super Deluxe room on 4th Floor (Top Floor). It costs us Rs 7500 thru MakeMytrip.com + Rs 500 for pre-checkin. I must say that this is the hotel one should prefer while visiting mussoorie for a pleasant and hassle-free stay.

1. Mall Palace Hotel is on mall road providing wonderful view of Dun/Doon Valley.
2. Ropeway (near Jhulaghar, Mall Road) is just in front of this hotel.
3. Kulri Market (having Mussoorie Sweet Shop, Mangloo's Kulcha & Momos Shop, 5D Cineblast & Scary House, branded showrooms, restaurant and gift shops etc.) is at walking distance of around 5 minutes. 
4. Main Points like Nirulas, Dominos, CCD, State Bank, Rikshaw Stand, Jwahar Aquarium are at walking distance of maximum 2 minutes only.
5. Library Market(Gandhi Chowk) is at walking distance of 5 minutes only.

Two extreme ends of mall road are:
1. Picture Palace/Kulri End have main market, taxi stand and bus stand. 
2. Library Market(Gandhi Chowk) End also have a small market, taxi stand and bus stand.

Ropeway (Jhulaghar) is almost in middle of these two ends. Best part of mall road is between Ropeway and Picture Palace/Kulri end having all kind of shops, eating points, branded showrooms and banks etc.

I asked hotel to arrange a pick-up for me from Dehradun Station at 8:00AM to hotel which costs me Rs 800 (Taxi hired from Dehradun taxi stand in Rs 610 will enter at mall road if you will pay entry fee of Rs 100 and Rs 100 for local charge only, else it will drop you at Picture Palace Taxi Stand). When I reached station I got my cab in 5 min and reached hotel around 9:30AM while my check-in time was 12:00PM. When I asked for pre-checkin I was charged for quarter day. Hotel staff took luggage from cab to hotel reception and from there to my room. I found room well managed and clean equipped with LCD TV with cable connection and a Refrigerator. 

Hot and cold water was never a problem as hotel was having excellent power backup facility. Even cleanliness and hygiene was never a matter of concern as washrooms & rooms dry n wet cleaning was a routine job along-with daily changing of bedsheets and towels.

Main places we visited are:
1. Jwahar Aquarium : Just a minute or two walk towards library end from ropeway having two most precious fishes among many (Rs 20/person, Rs 20 extra for photography or Rs 40 extra for videography).
2. 5D Cineblast and Scary House : At kulri end, must watch 10 minute 5D movie to have an amazing experience (Rs 150/person) and scary house (Rs 70/person)
3. Company Garden : At a distance of 5.5Km, can be reached only by Rickshaw (Rs 60/person single side)
4. Viewpoint Visit on top of hill by Ropeway (Rs 75/person both side ticket, time no bar).
5. Kempty Fall & Bodh Mandir : At a distance of around 15Km can be reached by hiring taxi  (Rs 820 from kempty fall taxi stand and Rs 1120 from picture palace taxi stand). Don't know about visit by private buses, somebody told Rs225 per seat in bus. Its better to share a taxi with other family/couple if you can.

On the day of check-out I asked hotel to arrange a coolie to carry luggage till picture palace taxi stand and they did in 5 minutes, collie charged Rs 70. Hotel staff never asked for tip and was very courteous. I booked a taxi to dehradun railway station which costs me Rs 760 (Rs 610 to dehradun railway station from picture palace taxi stand, Rs 100 for Mussoorie Lake sight-seeing for 1 hour on the way and Rs 50 for Shiv Mandir  visit for 15 minutes on the way).

Note:
1. Hotel food was not upto the expectation.
2. Cable TV goes as it seems that cable operator had no power backup, must be replaced by DishTV.
3. Dominos pizza was very costly as compared to prices in Delhi and base was different, tasteless pizza :(
4. Complete mall road can be visited by walking without any problem.
5. Watching 5D movie was amazing experience.
6. Prefer to have food outside based upon your taste and choice, will cost less, all kind of eating points available on mall road.

I hope this review will help others.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r143504111-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"306","50314215","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/ff/bb/e7/amit-from-delhi.jpg","550","3","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amit_From_Delhi","Amit_From_Delhi","9B450E9456EEFC7C19CC0CE42EA2686E",,,,,"Amit_From_Delhi",,"Guest Relations Manager","660497254","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Comfortable in the middle of the Mall Road","4","2012-09","2012-09-27","Pros-: 1. Located at the middle of the Mall Road. 2. Easy access to Ropeway, all major shops and eateries like Kalsang, Nirulas, Dominos, CCD etc. 3. Hotel has a lift and the Deluxe Balcony Rooms provide amazing views of Mussoorie and the Doon Valley. 4. Food is sometimes good, sometimes OK (You should instruct according to your preference). 5. Hotel Tariff and food rates are not exorbitant (not cheap also). 6. Staff is co-operative.
Cons-: 1. Lots of noise from the Mall Road would be reaching the rooms in the peak season. 2. Parking is there for only 5-6 Cars. 3. Bathroom could have been more clean and shinier. 4. Some in-house activities and more in-door games should be there.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r141391528-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"2448","41635786","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/7b/4f/ca/siddharthverma-1984.jpg","3264","520","333","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvSiddharthVerma","Adv.SiddharthVerma","46F7196D0C1BDEBE1D8AE6510E3F328C",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","AdvSiddharthVerma",,"Guest Relations Manager","660497274","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Nice Hotel Located On Mall Road","4","2012-08","2012-08-20","Hotel was located in the middle of mall road, next to the cable cars. Make sure that you have a private car to drop you off otherwise face a 10 minute walk with your heavy bags up a steep hill. The hotel is centrally located on the busy Mall road and a 2 minute walk to the shops and restaurants. There are several stairs to climb however it shouldnt be an issue for the average person. 
The Delux balcony room was spacious and service proved excellent. The downside was that the bathroom tiles needed a good clean and due to its location, noise levels due tend to rise during breakfast time however if youre up early then not an issue. By 10am, all is quiet once again.
Would stay again due to service of staff.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r137752545-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452389098","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1200","25","42","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dhasap","dhasap","CDCC8CCE088AA440D1866694561BEF4F",,,,,"dhasap",,"Guest Relations Manager","660497285","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Nice Hotel... A Good Start for our trip.. :)","4","2012-04","2012-07-28","I was there with my husband on 19th of April,2012. We stayed there for 3 nights. Situated just at the center of Mall road, It has close proximity to everything in Mussoorie, well what else do u need!!! The room was good, spacious.. The Dehradun Valley view from the balcony was mesmerizing... The best part was the trolley going up and down in front of our balcony!!! Yes This hotel is exactly in front of the Ropeway station which takes u to the gun point, uphill. Hence the Huge trolley was just a meter away from our balcony... The staff was very co-operative. Mr.Sanjay Agarwal, the MD is a very very nice person. He personally took interest to book our cab at a very good rate. (We were heading for Barkot-Yamnotri from there). The rickshaw stand too is just opposite, hence to go anywhere in mussoorie it was easy... Food was average... Would definitely recommend and go there next time... :)","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r135606441-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"450","45100174","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/b0/2c/8e/madhavirajee.jpg","337","13","109","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadhaviSharmaVoice","Madhavi S","A91C751B7390E1FE639E5CAC21FA253C",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","MadhaviSharmaVoice",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498031","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"Below Average","2","2012-06","2012-06-17","Was travelling with parents and chose this hotel because it's centrally located on the mall road. The location and view is surely good but that's all that there's is to this hotel ! Hotel Infrastructure, Rooms, Food Quality, Cleanliness, Hospitality are all below average. The hotel does not have a single restaurant. The hotel management ( Owner-Manager-Front Desk is one person) will not leave one chance to make an extra buck. Early check in and late check out is not accommodated even with room availability.

"Excellent Hotel made Pleasant stay","5","2012-03","2012-04-01","We went for our Honeymoon in March end 2012 for 3 nights & 4 days to Hotel Mall Palace, Mussoorie and we really liked the hotel. Very well maintained hotel in the mall road of Mussoorie. This hotel offers a very good ambiance for a comfortable stay. The rooms are well maintained and most of them have a very nice view of the mountains though they offered us a complementary up-gradation of the room which was really impressive but we were happy with the Luxury bath-tub room. The staffs are very courteous and liked their helping nature and from the housekeeping department, we received a call every morning if we needed to refresh our room which shows that they care about each and every thing to make sure that guests stay goes exceptionally well and same compliment goes to the kitchen department as well. The facilities provided are adequate and the rooms are spacious. The rooms and toilets are clean and well maintained. The view from this hotel was excellent and even we were on 2nd floor, it means you don’t require a higher floor room only to get good view. Food was excellent and had plenty of options. The stay was really comfortable and cozy. It helped us to relax and enjoy which we needed a lot as we were on honeymoon. The booking process was smooth with no hidden costs involved. Thanks to all the staffs and we had a wonderful stay and would surely recommend to everyone. 

Make your way to the hotel and enjoy your pleasant stay...!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d1156304-r127073112-Hotel_Mall_Palace-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"769","220060796","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/1d/dc/7c/roshkr.jpg","769","9","61","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoshKr","RoshKr","B39A4184668B337E59AAB77887A9AC6C",,"255111","Rotorua, New Zealand","Rotorua","RoshKr",,"Guest Relations Manager","660498141","en","2019-03-23","MALLPALACE","Dear Guest,

"It’s not a place, it’s an experience ","5","2018-02","2018-03-05","Summarizing this place in a paragraph is not going to do enough justice to it but I’m still going to try. So we got here at noon, after an hour an half long drive from Dehradun. It’s in a place called Hatipaon in Mussorie. Nestled in the heart of the mountains, Seagreen Lodge has a direct view of The George Everest peak and tourist attractions like Cloud End and Mall road are few Kms away. You can take a cab/bike or just trek to these places like we did. Would strongly recommend you to trek as we got great pictures and a wonderful experience out of it. About the Seagreen Lodge itself, it’s owned by this wonderful man Vicky, who is extremely warm and helpful and him with helpers Somender and cook Gudvir make you feel so at home. Special shootout to the cook though, at the end of the trip, you would want to take him home. The food was insanely awesome. From the coffee and sandwiches, the parathas to the local pahari dinner of sarso da saag and makke ki roti, everything was out of this world! The rooms are cozy and clean, but we hardly spent any time in there as we couldn’t get enough of the breathtaking view from the lobby and balcony. The cafe below is a pretty quaint place with an interesting collection of books and indoor games. It also has an outside seating, where we had most of our meals. 
The best thing about this place is the pristine silence that lets you enjoy and take in the soulfulness of the mountains as you cut off from your mundane city hustle. We had booked for just 1 night but ended up extending for another day and we’re glad we did. 
Just find your sweet spot either at the balcony, lobby, cafe or the veranda and read, write, sketch away your time while soaking in the beauty of everting this place has to offer.

"Ideal place to stay near Mussoorie for nature-lovers.","5","2018-01","2018-02-07","I have been wanting a vacation for a long time to take a break from daily schedule. Being from Mumbai, I was looking for a place away from the city hustle & bustle in Mussoorie. Luckily, I stumbled upon this property on Air BnB.

Situated about 4 km away from Library Chowk end of Mussoorie, this property is surrounded by lush green pine tree mountains. It is an ideal place to stay for people who are looking for a peaceful and serene accommodation.

The owners Vicky and his son Arjun were really great hosts. They made sure all my needs were taken care of during my stay there.

The rooms are simple, clean and cozy with all the necessary amenities one would need during the stay (Yes, including 24-hour hot water shower). The walls are thin though, so make sure you are considerate enough to not make loud noises and ruin the experience of your fellow guests.

The cafe downstairs offers some really lip-smacking food cooked by their cook Gudvir. Ginger Lemon Honey drink is something you would not wanna miss. They offer a variety of options on their menu for us to choose from. I would personally recommend Alu Paratha, Chocolate Waffles, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Masala and Dal Khichdi Tadka. The cafe also offers various books and magazines to read and games for kids to play. You can also connect your iPhone/iPod to their music system via Bluetooth and play music you like.

The room tariffs and the menu price are very pocket-friendly and are definitely worth every penny.

I would strongly recommend this property to everyone who wants to experience nature while in Mussoorie. Definitely coming back here soon.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r559006248-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"745","301780970","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/fc/cf/ea/alichikte.jpg","745","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alichikte","alichikte","A8ECE7CEC9D24C4FACFC874D93E82AEA",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","alichikte",,"Owner","568457219","en","2018-03-24","VickyL118","alibhai - thanks for 5 stars...arjun remembers the walk to the haunted LAMBI DHAR :) hope you encounter a lost spirit on your next hike :) cheers","Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"
"Beautiful, Cozy and Exciting","5","2017-08","2018-02-01","So normally I do not write reviews, but, this place definitely deserves one. It's a nice comfortable pocket floating among the clouds. The rooms are spacious and can comfortably accommodate 3 people. The ambiance of the place is what got me, the hotel is made in a very tasteful manner. The food at the cafe is to-die for (P.S - Don't miss out on the Ginger Lemon Honey). The staff is super warm and welcoming. They also have 2 playful and healthy dogs called Kama and Mogli, if you're a dog fanatic then all I can say is you're in for a treat. To top it up, it does not burn a hole in my pocket! 

Will I stay here again if I go back to Mussori?

"Heavenly place... Wanting to go back again","5","2018-01","2018-01-25","Though I've read about this place, I was skeptical as I was travelling with my family and was unsure of the size of the room (as we were 2 adults + 2 kids) and more importantly, the food. But, we were completely bowled over on all fronts. The amazing food, hospitality of the staff, the environment... it's a paradise. We stayed here for 4 days and whenever we wanted to get to the Mall, the staff helped us in getting a cab. It's just about 6 km to the Mall. Reasonable priced rooms and lip-smacking food makes this place a good bet. The room was compact (though not so huge) with an additional pull-out cot.

"Peace and Serenity","5","2017-10","2017-10-27","Hathipaon  is a place nestled between the green pine tree mountains surrounding the very famous hill station of Massuri, Uttarkhand-( India ). The area is a remote zone and promises to give peace and serenity and a break from the hustle bustle of city life. The place is not so popular amongst the holiday seekers who to prefer visit the parent town of Massuri but if you wish to seek to spend time with mother nature's bounties, this is the place to hit. SEEGREEN lodges are byfar the only decent property offering stay -

The property is accessible by good  roads till the doorstep , and location is simply awesome. Staying is comfort at its best given the remote location and hostile climate during winters - Waking up to the chirping of the birds with no snooze options promises a wonderful start to the day and the all day long café makes sure your taste buds get their dues .  There are couple of interesting places around the property ( Bird sanctuary and view points which open up to the valley ), which may require a bit of walking, but for a lazy day off - the property sounds just perfect to sit, chill and keep stress levels at bay .  I would wish to recommend the place STRICTLY FOR THOSE WHO CAN DIGEST THE MAGICAL SILENCE - AND ENJOY THE SOUNDS OF NATURE . The staff did really good to keep our stay as memorable as it could be . 

Food served is good, and the collection of books in the café are quite interesting. The café also boasts nice music, table games for the kids and ambiance quite classical.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r536457178-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"50","261435806","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/95/31/9e/kunal-9304.jpg","50","5","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/265kunals","Kunal S","A56888F0BD7CF91399C42BA4D5FF5D7F",,,,,"265kunals",,"Owner","536845746","en","2017-10-29","VickyL118","Hello kunal.

"A special resort !","5","2017-10","2017-10-17","A short drive from Clouds end, Mussoorie, is this rather quaint charming looking cottage, which we may have missed had not hunger pangs got the better of us. A pleasant discovery awaited us the moment we entered the cafe. An old world ambience, that you fall in love with instantly. Light coloured wooden furniture, an eclectic collection of books and magazines, table games, a speaker for some music and old posters of rock music gods like Jimi Hendrix, Eagles create the right ambience.

The ultimate was the food. The personal touch of the owners was evident even from the menu which has been delightfully written. Each item lovingly and freshly prepared with vegetables grown organically on the farm located on the premises was the clincher. The subzi-roti, noodles and soup were outstanding as was the service. The place also offers lodging facilities in three rooms on the upper floor which were neat and well furnished. Ideally located near a forest and a bird sanctuary, the tranquility makes it suitable for nature lovers and those in search of solitude.

If healthy and delicious food, in a cottage in sylvan settings is your weakness, you can't go wrong. This is the place for you.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r533797033-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452387929","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","1200","7","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rima1532344","Rima","055D1BE59106DB23065DAEA72647BC3B",,"1532344","Navi Mumbai, India","Navi Mumbai","Rima1532344",,"Owner","535827988","en","2017-10-24","VickyL118","hello rima,

"Hidden Gem among clouds","5","2017-09","2017-09-08","I came to know about this heaven while surfing for a getaway from the maddening city crowd.

This place had rave reviews from the travellers, hence went for a shot after checking through their website(which is self explanatory).

I must admit , i was a bit circumspect after the way the owners had warned us not to expect a resort.However as soon as the day i reached the property till the day I left every hour they kept on throwing surprises and  exceeding my expectations.

The Gems which made my trip sparkle are:-

1. The Property:-  
                            It is a beautifully located  single storey lodge , nestled among trees with breathtaking views. There are 3 rooms all being spacious and well kept.One thing which grabbed my attention was that its all wood, hence you can hear your steps:).
The corner room has splendid views on all sides along with a balcony. 
                            Ground floor is the cafe cum restaurant. I appreciate and applaud owners choices and intentions while creating such a cool place. The cafe has something for all, Books (Lots of them,all genre), board games , magazines. You have an option to play your song by connecting your cell through Bluetooth.
                             All in all value for money.

2. Food:-
                             I have been to many a hotels where we had no option but to eat outside as either the food is too expensive or its bad. 
                             However , this place is an exception, seldom I come across a place where the whole menu is their speciality:). This is one such place.
                             Aloo Paratha, masala chai, Honey chilli potato, Khichdi, Pahadi Kadhi, Barbecue, Pasta..... All were to die for , however Indian cuisine is one not to be missed 

3. Caretakers:-
                          There are 3 people who go out of the way to make your holiday a memorable one. Somendra,Gunveer and Soham.

                          

Looking forward to my nest trip at this place:):)","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r522515505-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rohit2539","Rohit Bhargava","2268A25112AC3B21D174EA34431FD4EE",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","Rohit2539",,"Owner","535830241","en","2017-10-24","VickyL118","wow rohit,
you described my place so well. M really happy that we made a memorable holiday for you!
Gudvir is a local cook and trained by my wife - i am so happy that travellers have admired his home cooked food time and again.
look froward to your next visit - weather is just getting nippy and we know that winter is just round the corner...bukharis are being cleaned as we would need them to create the required warmth.

"Worst & Best","2","2020-08","2020-08-15","Well Where do I start from. The place in pictures looks beautiful  and artistic and we booked because of that. We got a pretty decent deal and with these corona times we wanted our own space.

We had booked 5 rooms out of the 7. The place is decent but a bit of hike . Parking is on the main road where ur cars are not safe . 

Hygiene  - the place is dirty to the core and not at all maintained . Pictures show a very different picture of the place . It’s smelly , there is damp, lights and gyser and shower are not working . There is water on the floor as it was raining . 

Food - the food is wonderful . Menu is short but that is understandable. We had most of our meals there as we liked what they cooked . 

Accessibility- it’s pretty close to the Mall Road so that is a nice part but is a steep climb to reach the place . 

Staff - The in house staff is great . People
Sitting in delhi are pretty helpful but it’s very confusing at times who you talking to . 

Communication- they have these numbers there and it’s irritating as it’s so bloody difficult to reach them. 

All in all good place and good view but bad hygiene and bad maintenance.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d8435492-r765101647-Seclude_Mussoorie-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452387495","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","1200","4","20","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swarajs48","Swaraj Singhi","6F53CDEB4A823BCF75ED82E171DFD12E",,,,,"swarajs48",,"Guest Services / Front Office","766927052","en","2020-08-25","Mohit Kohli","Hi Swaraj,

"Best Stay!!","5","2020-03","2020-03-03","This place is one of the best stay in Mussoorie without any doubt!
My fiancee opted this place as a surprise for me and it truly was a surprise. The location is so beautiful to enjoy with your family and friends. Mr. Nitin and Mr. Manoj made sure about each and every bit of our stay. The food was scrumptious and Mr. Sanjay served one of the finest cocktail to us. 
Talking about the room, we booked the Purple Room which was so beautiful with a private gallery. 
The interiors and exteriors are so great. And the scenic beauty that lurks in front of the outdoor seating area is just mesmerising. 
Overall I would definitely opt this place in future and recommend it everyone.

"For a quiet, walking holiday","5","2017-04","2017-09-04","I spent three days at Seegreen in April this year and was charmed by the experience.  Nice, homely food, long walks towards the bird sanctuary, wonderfully pleasant weather and, most importantly, peace! (though on a Sat, the traffic by the side road to Everest point was a touch irritating).  
The accommodation is warm and comfortable, though the bathrooms are small and needed some attention (which Vicky, the owner, mentioned they'd do).  If you are travelling to Mussorie and would like to stay away from the town and the tourism zone (that includes Landour), this is the place.
When I do visit Mussorie again, Seegreen will be my preferred stay option.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r521265416-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","5","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goparuna","Goparuna","B5F363DC0ECB48C8C19C22F464A81861",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","Goparuna",,"Owner","535830604","en","2017-10-24","VickyL118","hello traveller,

"Great peaceful stay","4","2017-05","2017-08-27","Location is little far from Mall road but this is the beauty of the place. Very peaceful surrounded with scenic beauty. The place is equipped with all basic necessities and one should not expect a hotel or resort kind of services as this is not either. Food was very delicious and staff was also good. I have only 2 suggestions, rest all was perfect- 
1. If guests have arrived at 10PM and extremely tired, asking for tea, please oblige with smile even if you are not a hotel or resort. Tea is a very basic ask and not luxury. When we reached after 14 hours of tiring road journey, we asked for tea and apparently the staff was not very happy with our request and reacted in a disappointing note. Tea served was not good either. though it is a very small thing but why to give a single chance to guests to complain :)                                                                                           2. Water for basic daily work is a necessity and first day we had to wait for half an hour for water supply to start smoothly so that we can start with bathing and all.

Your point is noted for the tea. have taken corrective steps already. as you know - we have only 3 pahari boys who are sufficient for the 3 rooms + boutique cafe. However, on the day of your arrival, there was a party by a local politician and that tired out our team...regrets for the same.

Thanks for regarding us with 4 starts. you taking time out for a review means a lot to us and we look forward to seeing you again soon at the lodge

"Quaint little place nestled amidst silence and a sea of green","4","2017-07","2017-07-19","I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking to stay away from the hubbub of the main stream city and the Mall Road - like we were! For the noise, there is Delhi. But for the idleness of the quite mountains blanketed with green and sporadically spotted with bell-necked hill cows grazing lazily, there is Hathipaon. Seegreen is 10 steps away from a stretch where these heavenly meadows unfurl. But before that, be prepared to wake up to clouds in your balcony!

The rooms are on the smaller side but perfect for two people. The cafe and the rooms are done up tastefully, the food is very fresh and they take about 30-45 minutes to prepare whatever you want to eat. Net net we loved the cottage, the cafe, the vibe, the location and the food. Thumbs up!

"FABULOUS Stay ... !!!","4","2017-06","2017-07-02","I was bit nervous before booking this kind of stay as I was not sure of location and service but after reaching the destination I found myself between the the one of best location I have ever been too in India. Seegreen lodge is very easy to reach as it is located at corner of  the main road leading to Kemty fall,, During the day it becomes little noisy due to honking on road but Morning and evening are very pleasant with bird singing. The food at the cafe is very tasty and freshly cooked. SOMENDRA and his team (Care taker) are very friendly and very attentive. This place is only for those people who wants relax and enjoy the nature, 

Pros:
1) Very good location
2) Staff is very friendly
3) Rooms are very well laid out though little congested for triple occupancy.
4) Food at cafe is very tasty and fresh

Cons:
1) Need to improve on House keeping 
2) Room we stayed in had very bad foul smell but Ok with exhaust fan in bathroom, I think that is due to plumbing mistek. 
3) cleaning of bathroom

Room Tips:
1) They have three rooms, choose room in either corner as it has extra window with good view.

I would defiantly recommend this place for the people who wants to relax and rejuvenate themselves with nature.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r497838973-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"574","110715563","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/99/62/ab/bhavesh2102.jpg","574","14","27","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bhavesh2102","Bhavesh2102","6BCB6AEC00B8C73F8A0B86E28446C823",,"297608","Ahmedabad, India","Ahmedabad","Bhavesh2102",,"Owner","535850174","en","2017-10-25","VickyL118","hello bhavesh

"Homely stay.","4","2017-06","2017-06-13","It is located in Hathipaon, just a few minutes from Mall Road. The stay is homely and the food is good in the cafe. 

It's quiet in the morning but the road becomes busy as the day progresses, resulting in traffic noise. 

Also it is located in a village, so expect frequent power cuts. The cable TV in the room was not working as it required top up. 

Hope the management rectifies this.

Sights of trees, mountains, avifauna, and a few villagers going about their chores is all you get over here.
The rooms are well furnished and have all the basic amenities. The restaurant (SeeGreen Cafe), tastefully decorated, serves a wide variety of delectable fare. The staff is courteous and prompt and attended to every trivial need of ours.
There are quite a few trails nearby for the bird-watcher / nature walker, which add to the attractiveness of the property. Mall Road, too, ain't far away - a 10 minute drive takes you straight to Library Chowk.
The real pleasure is in sitting on the veranda, after a long walk, sipping ginger tea, and reading a Ruskin Bond book while birds play a sweet symphony in the background.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r480880627-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"564","165153740","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/d8/0b/cc/maneeshgoal.jpg","564","248","82","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManeeshGoal","ManeeshGoal","98E056AA3E438FED99C4B2BEA85EE0BC",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","ManeeshGoal",,"Owner","488098877","en","2017-05-26","VickyL118","hi maneesh,

Both the hikes were totally worth it and when we came back tired at the end of the day, we were welcomed with great food (The yellow dal, yum!), hospitality of both the bhaiyas, board games and a small library which made our stay just perfect.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r478204638-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"577","252726731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/10/4d/cb/shuchi-s.jpg","577","14","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShuchiS64","Shuchi S","486490FECDCC311D73A071A644012732",,,,,"ShuchiS64",,,,,,,,"Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"
"beautiful stay in the lap of the Mountains!!","5","2017-04","2017-04-17","Imagine a stay where cloud floating in the lap of mountains. Isn't this line is super exciting? Well, I booked this hotel for 9 family members just by seeing pics and reviews online.  These were the words of my parents ""This place is just like heaven, like you can actually touch clouds"" :). I was glad and felt i made the right choice by booking this. Fantastic home stay with beautiful cafe. Owner Vicky and care taker both were really helpful. I must say if you want to enjoy real mussorie, this stay with peace and away from the crowd is perfect for any and everyone. my family members had private vehicle so there were no issues of transportation for them.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r476307607-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452392461","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PranotiP4","Pranoti P","C07CCB01885296F971B19C7BA779739C",,,,,"PranotiP4",,"Owner","476877995","en","2017-04-18","VickyL118","Hi pranoti.

"Quiet gateway in the hills","5","2017-03","2017-03-31","We were keen to do a day trek around Mussoorie and were looking for a quiet base for the night. Research for hotels and resorts did not yield the kind of properties we were looking for. However, we hit the jackpot when we tweaked our search term to homestay! Seegreen lodges is perfect if you are looking for a quiet hideaway, homely food and lovely trek paths. Not to mention some gorgeous avian friends who entertain you for free! And then there is Tama, the adorable puppy. 

The staff knows how to smile and is super friendly. The views from the first floor is soothing for stressed urban souls. The lodge's proximity to George Everest Point, Benog Hill, Mussoorie town makes it perfect for people who love to walk. Especially, if you could get up a bit early, the roads are all yours. 

Kudos to the owners and staff for keeping the place basic yet tantalizingly appealing for nature lovers!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297689-d3529823-r471591644-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html",,"1200","452390050","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","1200","4","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anirban075","anirban075","3FBA9923FD9F15E9A950AF2E7BFB6654",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","anirban075",,,,,,,,"Hathipaon Near George Everest Point Road, Mussoorie 248179 India","Mussoorie","India","248179","Uttarakhand","Hathipaon","Near George Everest Point Road","3529823","30.460978","Mussoorie, Dehradun District, Uttarakhand","78.02964","Seegreen Lodges","294","4.7","2","1","7","51","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297689-d3529823-Reviews-Seegreen_Lodges-Mussoorie_Dehradun_District_Uttarakhand.html","http://www.seegreenlodges.com"
