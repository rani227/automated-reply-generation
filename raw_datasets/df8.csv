"Not Recommended","1","2025-02","2025-03-04","No heater for the room. However you can hire a small useless bar one for 300 rupees per night. For a city where it’s very cold, found this pathetic. When we told them we were checking out after the first night coz it was freezing, they did bring us a heater free of charge. 
Bed was rock hard and pillows uncomfortable. No hot water. Apparently you get it at 7 in the morning but at 9AM we still did not have hot water. Was told to have a bucket shower by boiling the water. Seems the hot water gets turned off in the afternoon. Again pathetic for a freezing city.
There is a restaurant on site but not really staffed. We did order some dinner and the food was actually tasty and reasonably priced.
Noisy as staff shouts and talk loud when everyone is in bed. No consideration for guests who are trying to sleep.
It’s not a 3* so don’t be fooled. Check in next door at the Cedar Grand instead. That’s better value and a much nicer hotel. (which is what we did)
The only thing it has going for itself, is the view.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r996660280-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452390984","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg","1200","1","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greg-Medgee","Greg-Medgee","DF725ED5A579CB34A04C094AF18EB741",,"255103","Perth, Australia","Perth","Greg-Medgee",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"
"It’s a shame in the name of a hotel","1","2025-01","2025-01-30","Guys, if you have ever known staying in a decently clean place, then please please SIMPLY AVOID STAYING HERE!!!
It was so pathetic that it is literally a shame that owners of such properties blatantly sell their rooms calling themselves a hotel. It is worst than some Dharamshala.
The rooms have aged beyond their legitimate life and the interiors could be suitable for shooting some Ramsay Bandhu horror movies! Beds were creaky, unclean, probably the bedsheets weren’t washed and in fact one of the mattress had missing springs so it just plopped in when we sat on it.
The bathroom has no window or ventilation, stinks like hell, water faucets leaking and dripping and the bathroom floor was sticky and slippery in most areas except right under the shower where it was probably most frequently used.
In the freezing January winter of Shimla, the hotel had the audacity to charge us extra Rs. 250 for a room heater, which were also “jugaad” since one out of two coils was missing, so no real heating!
They advertise that they are close to Mall Road, but they are a good half an hour uphill walk to the Mall Road, and it is a distance for which you get no taxis or public transportation. 
All in all, an extremely poor hotel, with staff that was blatantly indifferent towards how bad a property they were running. Please avoid!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r991595452-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452392029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","17","26","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajit_Vibhandik","Ajit_Vibhandik","CC6563F71AE302B350B89163D99248C8",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","Ajit_Vibhandik",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"

"Felt cheated. Poor hotel.","1","2024-05","2024-06-09","We were searching for a good room for our holidays on booking.com and suddenly we saw a very beautiful hotel in Shimla, The pictures they had shown on booking.com were completely different from the front, meaning it was not good at all.When we asked that you do not have a window side room, he said, yes but you will have to pay Rs 6000 extra.
We gave a total of 19000 rupees for 4 days.They told us to cancel the booking which you have made through booking.com.We canceled the earlier booking, the city was new and it was evening time so we decided to stay there.
There was a lot of dust in the room, the window glasses were dirty, the shower was not working, the fan was also not working, both of them were repaired when I tried to tell them.The fan was making such a loud noise that night, that I was having trouble sleeping and the next day they changed the fan, fixed the shower but hot water was continuously coming from both the taps and I could not bathe.
We slept for a little longer so the time to wake up was 10:45 then we thought let's go and have breakfast, then I called around 11 am  the reception to order for breakfadt , he said that the time for breakfast is untill 10 am, still I will check  and let you know.
We waited for an hour but there was no call from Mr. We wasted our time for nothing. Unprofessional!! 
The staff there are very nice.

We paid 4500 per room for a bathroom sized room. With no facilities. The fan was not working. When asked for tea they said it's dinner time. When ordered lunch they said we have only chapati as we don't use tandoor so no naan available. Booked one room in triple occupancy but they didn't provide us separate bedding. Hot water cattle was there but without tea or sugar bags. They don't even have enough parking space. Every time one had to arrange his car when the other was leaving. Rooms are so small with no proper ventilation. The limited food they provide in their restaurant is tasteless. Overall it was a pathetic stay in this pathetic property. One more thing. They charged us 4500 for one room and in front of us they charged 2200 for the same room.

"Money-Minded Hotel with Zero Concern for Customer Safety","1","2025-09","2025-09-13","Money-Minded Hotel with Zero Concern for Customer Safety

I strongly advise travelers to avoid this hotel at all costs. This is one of the most money-minded establishments I have ever come across, with the worst cancellation and refund policy you can imagine.

Due to heavy landslides and washed-out roads, my flights and train journeys were canceled. On top of that, the government itself issued advisories asking people to avoid non-essential travel to Shimla, Kinnaur, and Spiti regions. Naturally, I had no choice but to cancel my 15-day Spiti Valley circuit trip — no sensible person would risk their life in such dangerous conditions.

Out of the 8 hotels I had booked, every single one promptly refunded my booking without hesitation, understanding the seriousness of the situation — except this hotel. Instead of showing empathy or even basic customer understanding, they only offered to change my booking dates within 10 days, completely ignoring the fact that trains, flights, and road routes were shut. How exactly do they expect someone from Bangalore to magically show up in Shimla within two weeks under such conditions?

This hotel refused to refund a single rupee. Their rigid, money-first approach clearly shows that customer safety and satisfaction mean nothing to them.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r1030132668-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vnagrawal06","Vikee","8FE6F544D97D5B60CBE54EC6EF3FE27A",,,,,"Vnagrawal06",,,,,,,,"The Mall Near Gorton Castle Square, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"The Mall","Near Gorton Castle Square","1405599","31.105461","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16361","Hotel Landmark","421","3.8","25","28","74","173","121","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1405599-Reviews-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotellandmarkshimla.com/"

"Nice hotel with connectivity to Mall road","4","2024-06","2024-06-28","We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in June 2024 and overall a good experience but service can improve a bit.
Pros:
1) Location is right next to victory tunnel and the lift takes you to top floor which opens up on the mall road. It's a 10-15 minutes walk to the start of the mall road (BSNL building).
There are HRTC buses and cabs but usually those are full with no seat availability.
2) Room is good , we stayed in the family suite which has 2 double beds 2 bathroom..
It can accommodate family of 4.. It Fully air conditioned..
3) Room Service is kind of mixed, sometime the response is good while other time it takes time..
Also, there should be a single number for all services but you have to call different numbers for room service, cleaning , house keeping etc..
They should internally have a mechanism to pass on the info.
4) Food:
Food is good and the the qty is also good 

Cons:
1) Parking : Although hotel has its its own parking but they do not take responsibility of any damage to your car in their premises.
It happened to us wherein our car was damaged in their parking and they simply told us that due to Monkeys it's damaged..
SO PLEASE PARK at your OWN RISK.... Hotel will simple not take care of your car.
2) staff courtesy can be improved .. I am not saying that they were rude or anything but the people at reception were bit indifferent 
... Usually in Hotel guests are welcome but here there that gesture was missing.

All and all a good experience with little room for improvement ","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r957038553-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","101253193","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/09/00/49/amanpreet1982.jpg","50","28","165","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amanpreet1982","Amanpreet Singh","813F7919297E4207D7E289685ABF3C2C",,,,,"amanpreet1982",,,,,,,,"The Mall Near Gorton Castle Square, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"The Mall","Near Gorton Castle Square","1405599","31.105461","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16361","Hotel Landmark","421","3.8","25","28","74","173","121","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1405599-Reviews-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotellandmarkshimla.com/"

"Overall a good stay","4","2022-12","2023-01-01","I would say the hotel is overall good.
The location is good and they have ample parking. They have a lift which leads to mall road and the main area is 10 min walking.
Rooms are bit small without balcony. But the rooms are clean. We stayed in super deluxe room and the view from room was very good.
Hot water in washrooms everytime.
Washrooms were little old style but clean
Food was good too.
The staff is also good.

I found the hotel food is average, the service is very poor. Cleanliness very bad, the bathrooms were not cleaned properly, I found hair all over from the previous guest. The towels and bed sheets were not clean. Post Covid such situation makes one feel extremely jittery. I did not had the option to not to stay in this hotel on the second visit within 2 weeks, however when I visited in September I stayed in a different hotel and found it to be way better than this hotel.
The positive part of the hotel is their access to Mall Road through the hotel lift and they have a nice terrace, I am surprised why they did not convert the terrace into a restaurant, their restaurant is very shabby, the sofas were not clean and the food was average. The rooms are not sound proof, noise from the lobby or the adjacent rooms disturbed me throughout the night.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r809814474-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"270","314509375","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/bf/08/3f/arinds.jpg","270","92","910","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arinds","arinds","4605A3CF7DB194ADDA6AE7A81B81138F",,"644043","Noida, India","Noida","arinds",,,,,,,,"The Mall Near Gorton Castle Square, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"The Mall","Near Gorton Castle Square","1405599","31.105461","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16361","Hotel Landmark","421","3.8","25","28","74","173","121","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1405599-Reviews-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotellandmarkshimla.com/"

Cons
1) rooms are old with not so great furniture

3) Santisation measures at the breakfast were not up to the mark. I would rather blame the guests than them. It never felt there is a pandemic.

"Comfortable place to stay in Shiimla","4","2019-08","2019-09-20","I stayed with my colleague on a business trip to Shimla for one night in the month of August 2019. Overall the Hotel was good comfortable place to stay near Victory Tunnel - old property and perhaps needs some updating on furniture. 15/20 min walking distance to Mall Road - Hotel Lift has access on the Mall Road. The room had a good view as well.
The food served in the Restaurant was good with decent portion sizes and at reasonable prices. The buffet breakfast included in the tariff was also quite ok but lacked in variety of spread.
It was worth the price we paid for on MMT - the Hotel was giving room at much higher rate and as such booked it on MMT from the Hotel Lobby.
Would not mind staying here again for a night or so on business trip.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r711345392-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"300","249478887","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/de/be/e7/milindkshirsagar.jpg","300","20","317","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilindKshirsagar","MilindKshirsagar","4E37B1146A02B7B3BCE6BF9DDFCF7872",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","MilindKshirsagar",,,,,,,,"The Mall Near Gorton Castle Square, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"The Mall","Near Gorton Castle Square","1405599","31.105461","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16361","Hotel Landmark","421","3.8","25","28","74","173","121","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1405599-Reviews-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotellandmarkshimla.com/"
"Awesome 👍😁😊","5","2019-09","2019-09-18","I stayed 16 to 18 September. However I left early on 17th Evening only. But to be honest  I like this place alot. Breakfast Less quantity of food. But quality of food mind blowing. Service Top class. 
One person who took my ❤️🙈. I don't know his name but he's God at that point of time for me. I checked in at 14:00 and left that place around 14:30 as I have to Kufri and chail. While returning am facing seviour pain in my shoulders and back. As I am riding bike almost 120 KM. WHEN I returned I asked to deliver #Move or Volini but all shops were closed. I pissed off Person who came to my room returned my money back he saw me and replied Sir I am sorry all shops closed nothing is available but if you want I will give my personal pain relief gel to you. I was like very happy. He came and give to me. That was awesome and extra miles for any guest. I replied Sir thanks alot you saved my night or else I will be die. I gave him 100 bucks for that gel. I know it's too less but unfortunately I am not carrying cash at that moment. 

In room service : I liked Mr . Lakhnpal he is also very good. I will definitely recommend this other to everyone.

"Very nice hotel for Shimla stay","4","2019-06","2019-09-05","We stopped over at Shimla on the way to Spiti valley, and on the return journey too. This is a decent hotel, with a nice view of the town, and spacious rooms. Most importantly, it had a car access from near Victoria Tunnel, and an elevator that opened onto the Mall Road. The distance till the Scandal point is not too short in the mid-day heat, but for evening walks its fantastic. If you can not walk a couple of kms, then it may be a bit difficult, but for us, it was perfect. We chose this after going through several hotels, and even though their parking lot is not huge, and every person in the reception was not ""super warm"", but both times they gave us good rooms on the 4th floor, overlooking the hills and a part of the town. Even packed breakfast was okay, if not royal. We had dinner on both nights (by room service) and it was alright. Not exactly fine dining, but huge portions and quick service. We may stay here again, but for someone who wants to spend more time along the ridge, this is the place to stay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r706771192-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"2000","58064777","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/75/ff/89/sumana-gau.jpg","3008","26","101","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/396sumanad","Sumana D","4B0CE35B766AB207F22A9B1FC3FE4F58",,"503692","Guwahati, India","Guwahati","396sumanad",,,,,,,,"The Mall Near Gorton Castle Square, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"The Mall","Near Gorton Castle Square","1405599","31.105461","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16361","Hotel Landmark","421","3.8","25","28","74","173","121","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1405599-Reviews-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotellandmarkshimla.com/"
"Beautifal hotel, fast service , lift to mall road but its around 1.5 km ridge from lift","3","2019-06","2019-06-21","we stayed for two days in june .
Beautiful hotel next to victory tunnel , rooms clean and great fast service to rooms.
Food is ok because dinner we tried at night is great but  breakfast at both days are ok. Options are quite few .
there is also parking facility available at hotel but limited .
Main thing is lift , LIFT OPENED AT ROAD WHICH GOES TO MALL ROAD ... BUT ITS 1.5 KM FROM MALL ROAD/RIDGE AND ROAD TO THAT IS LIKE CLIMB UP to mountains.
I have booked super deluxe rooms but what i get is an room which is An  FULLY AC but its surrounded  from walls from all sides . So i feel congestion . So my suggestion is to you guys is that please check before  booking whether they will provide window/ balcony in that category or not to you . They will try to give online booked rooms  to that congested room's and by personal bookings they provide gud rooms in that category.
Its some how feel like cheated because you have paid the same amount of money  that other guys paid  for the same category.
So beware For this type of situation otherwise hotel is good.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r683130637-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","178691409","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/a6/9d/51/amitsinghal1986.jpg","50","20","63","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amitsinghal1986","amitsinghal1986","0F11FBA783BA496E97B0F8940E2C746B",,"667805","Kanpur, India","Kanpur","amitsinghal1986",,,,,,,,"The Mall Near Gorton Castle Square, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"The Mall","Near Gorton Castle Square","1405599","31.105461","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16361","Hotel Landmark","421","3.8","25","28","74","173","121","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1405599-Reviews-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotellandmarkshimla.com/"
"Good Location, great view","4","2019-06","2019-06-14","Hotel Landmark is very conveniently located next to Victory tunnel. The hotel has ample covered parking space for people like me who prefer to travel by their own car. The hotel has around 100 rooms spread over 5 floors. It also has a bar and restaurant. The food served in the hotel is quite good in terms of both quality and quantity, prices are also reasonable. The hotel provides direct access to the mall road through their elevator, however, the main mall road market is at a distance of about 800 metres, with a slight acclivity while heading towards the mall road, which is a little on the higher side if you are travelling with elders or children. There is however, electric buses/vans plying on the route at some intervals.  The walk back to the hotel is a lot easier as it's down hill. The rooms in the hotel are spacious and clean & provide a good view of the valley and parts of Shimla. Room Service in the Hotel is very prompt and professional.

"Very average hotel ","3","2018-05","2018-06-02","Location is good, very well connected to Mall road and main town. 
Service is poor and slow. 
Food is below average , some of us skipped hotel breakfast and ate outside.
Hotel hardly cares about customer feedback as they are located on mall road an will get clients anyway. I believe the owners of property dont pay personal attention to their business.
Interiors of room dont give premium feel. We stayed in honeymoon deluxe room and booked 3 rooms.
Their travel desk is worst. Hotel reception themself recommend to book from outside which is actually right, the guy at travel desk is a cheat, he talks nicely with commitments and then later you will regret booking with him when cab wont come or come very late. 
He only contacts outside cab drivers who may or may not come on his call. Taxi stand is just outside the hotel on mall road so better get cab dron their only at less price.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r584530268-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452388586","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","1200","35","59","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N_Singhal","N_Singhal","44247460BE3822F76D79A0892A6F04BC",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","N_Singhal",,"General Manager","587974515","en","2018-06-16","ThakurPawan","Dear Valued Guest

The location of the hotel is very good, near to Jakhoo Ropeway. It on the mainroad groundfloor property, looking very nice from outside. Centrally located to visit the Mall Road. Cars without permits NOT ALLOWED as hotel is in RESTRICTED ZONE. One has to walk with luggage atleast 1 km stretch.
Our experience during our stay is not satisfactory. 
First impression is the last impression. Hotel do not have the concierge staff to pickup the luggage from the road into the hotel and to the room, we had to do it ourselves.
The bedsheet was clearly seen not made up clean before our checkin but the reception staff refused to accept that it is not clean.
The complimentary “RO Water” kept in the room was provided in bottle without cap. 
There was no heater in the room. The Geyser available in the room was said to be taking atleast one hour to get hot water. We had to get bucket of hot waters instead for our needs.
 With weather around 3-4degree in the night hotel took a long time to provide extra blanket, after lot of deliberations.
No wifi password was provided by the reception, but later provided by the manager, probably the owner of the property.
The breakfast and dinner quality was good.
We had paid for Rs.9,860/- per night room charges. However, i strongly feel that it was not worth the room charge as projected in OYO (almost double) but trusting oyo brand and very good offer and experience at other oyo hotels, had paid here the total in advance before checkin. Now have no option but to put in our grievance about this hotel service and the room charge that do not meet the charge actually meant for.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1009876-r736806476-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452391659","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shimlatravel","ASHOK SHETTY","73165EC9BB0FFFDB9AA889C9AC7BD3D1",,,,,"shimlatravel",,,,,,,,"The Ridge Near Christ Church, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"The Ridge","Near Christ Church","1009876","31.10133","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17907","Hotel Shiwalik Regency","84","3.1","25","6","14","12","27","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1009876-Reviews-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://hotelshiwalikregency.business.site/?m=true"
"Nightmare of a place","1","2019-09","2019-10-17","Guest Beware! 

I had a nasty experience at this hotel that made me cut my 5 days fully paid stay to less than 24hours. And during these 24 hour I was in an internet café calling MMT to tell them my problems and trying to get a refund of 4 days. While MMT assured me that I will get a full refund, this did not happened. People please beware of what you see and read online about this hotel. They show availability of wifi but that is not true. The guest relation executive (GRE) tried to lie to me by saying that all the hotels in Shimla does not have wifi. What they fail to mentioned is that there are no elevators in this hotel and you have to walk for miles to get there. Also, the room they offered me was full of mold which can cause respiratory problems. Also, I was told not to open any doors or windows because of monkey problems however there was no fan or air-condition in the rooms cutting off ventilation. When I told the GRE he became nasty and told me to contact MMT and complaint to them.

The room service was equally horrible as the staff was very lazy abd i wasnt provided with the promised services. The hotel didn provide us with the basic amenities like towels, napkins, clean washrooms, etc. The room service was the worst as they took a lot of time to fulfill a single need and for that as well i had to call like 5 times.

We booked 2 rooms via MMT triple occupancy each but they gave us 1 family room and 1 room with double occupancy. The family room was still better but the other room was STINKING, washroom was so poor that we cant even stand there let alone use. Now let me highlight the service which was the WORST part of our stay, the staff was lazy, unapologetic, uninterested and least bothered about the guests. There were no clean towels, the water was smelly and yellow in colour. The room service was the worst as we have to call for the same thing for like 4 times and after that as well the staff was least bothered of our needs.

"Please do not visit this Hotel,you will regret","2","2017-08","2017-08-06","I booked it through MAKE MY TRIP 
Cons:
1) I booked for View Rooms but when entered it did not have any view neither from window nor any balcony. 
2) I informed Make my trip. Hotel Owner clearly said to Make My Trip that we do not have rooms. It was mistake from both Make My Trip and Hotel.
3) TV was just a joke. every 2 minutes we had to restart.Remote was not working so we had to get up and turn the Switch off. 
4) Dont Book this Hotel as it says it is nearer to Mall road and all... It is far away from Mall road. At least 800 meters away and these 800 meters is not straight road , you get exuasted.
5) If i speak something, it was clearly audible in another room. Very cheap structure.
So i recommend try better option and go with hotel which is just next to mall , check the actual distance if it is mroe than 200 meters then do not book it. This hotel is not suitable for couples and families.
6)  In the breakfast , you will get only pickle with Paratha.
7) When I was checking out from here , I gave the credit card. Hotel owner was on the counter and refused to credit card , debit card. He gave unacceptable reason like machine is not working and all.

Pros: 
1) The only pros is It is next Rope way which takes to Jakhu temple. But again not sure about safety of this Rope way as it is newly started.
2) Food was average.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1009876-r509223850-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","255661218","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/3d/14/a2/pankaj-l.jpg","50","5","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PankajL88","Pankaj L","9D394C509F2E9C2B738E2A18FC12D257",,,,,"PankajL88",,,,,,,,"The Ridge Near Christ Church, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"The Ridge","Near Christ Church","1009876","31.10133","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17907","Hotel Shiwalik Regency","84","3.1","25","6","14","12","27","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1009876-Reviews-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://hotelshiwalikregency.business.site/?m=true"

"A big No-No","1","2017-03","2017-06-06","I don't feel like putting a lot of effort and time in writing a review for this property as this has been one of the worst properties I've ever stayed till date. Me along with my mum and dad stayed at this hotel from 10-12th of March 2017 and I'm still regretting my decision. I'll be quick,the owner is rude and aggressive, The hotel staff will try to act like they are very helpful and welcoming but you'll get to know when they'll start charging you for each and everything. They charge you 300 rs for using an old electric room heater on a daily basis and will always come up with an excuse stating that electricity is expensive in Shimla that's why they room heaters and hair dryers are on a chargeable basis. You can buy a brand new heater for 500 rs instead of paying 300 rs on a daily basis just to use it. Still can't believe it. In future they might start charging their customers for breathing fresh air as well. Rooms were in a terrible condition, we booked a suite which had 2 double beds. It was snowing outside. Mattresses and blankets were stinking as if they haven't been dry cleaned for donkey years.We had to manage with drinking cold tea. The room service food prices are atrocious and will make you crack up. A cup of tea will cost you something around 80 rs (excluding taxes) and when you know it's raining and snowing outside you won't go out and will have to bear their prices and excuses. It seems like more than the tourists the hotel owner is making the most of the unpredictable weather in Shimla. The only good thing about the hotel is it is physically their in Shimla. A big NO-NO.

"Worst Stay and Fraud in Bills","1","2016-07","2016-07-31","My friends and I stayed in so called Family Suite which is so small in size that you can't even walk properly in the room. The suite is with balcony which is way small,only 2 person can go at one time but you can't sit there.
Wifi never worked which they mentioned at the time of check-in that your room is with free-wifi.

For the food we had they charged us twice for the same dish again and again.

I would not suggest this hotel to anyone as you can't take your private vehicle to the hotel.

Hotel Surya's room service and customer service are the most annoying issues. 

It takes 20-30 mins on average for the hotel staff to respond to room service or other requests. 
 
Amenities are okay-ish. Some basic things are missing, though. For example - the Wi-Fi almost never worked during our 2-day stay.

"Nice place for stay in Shimla","4","2022-07","2022-07-31","Hotel Surya is an old property and has about 12 floors. It has a new wing and an old wing with the restaurant nested between the two. One lift is there for the old wing for floors 1 to 8 and another one for the new wing. you exit one lift, cross the dining area and then enter the other lift. As soon as you exit the victory tunnel, you can see the board of the hotel so reaching it is very easy. They have parking at the hotel but it is limited and at the time of rush, you have to plan properly. 

Reception area is small but well laid out and clean. It has a small sitting area also with newspapers of the day available for reading. you have to take stairs to reach the reception area from parking/road. 

Rooms are adequate size and bathrooms are large. The hotel provides the toiletries along with clean towels. Hot water is available always and the room has a tv with cable connection. Bed is ok and there is a small seating area with two sofa chairs. Each room has a good size cupboard and ample tables to keep for luggage, items etc. Best thing is that the hotel provides you room slippers. 

In the new wing, you have a passage  which leads to the mall road. But you have to climb some 30 odd stairs to reach the road. So you can visit mall road as many number of times you want by foot saving lot of time. If you are health conscious, you can go for an early morning stroll or jog as well.  I used to go to mall road for morning walk, then to office for work and then for softy ice-cream after dinner. Watching the stars and the lit hills late in the night while licking your softy at the ridge is a memorable experience. 

The hotel provides breakfast but the spread is limited and fixed. However, the dining area is spacious, with nice view of the valley below. Food is good and we had nice dinner during our stay. You should try mushroom dishes if you are in hills. 

Service is top class. very friendly and prompt. you have intercom for dialing reception and room service. Service has an old world charm to it as some of the staff i guess have been there for number of years. 

The hotel has a wi-fi but it is not very reliable so always have a back up just in case. the room has ample number of power sockets so you will not be left wanting if you have number of devices to charge. 

Try to book get one of the bigger VIP rooms which are kind of suite rooms. They have some special room for newly weds also. I enjoyed my stay as my work was on mall road and i used to just walk and reach my place in 15-20 mins. As you go towards the mall road, a small detour of 5 mins takes you to the famous kalibari temple of Shimla. The temple offers breathtaking views of Shimla and surroundings. 

I will definitely recommend people to experience the hotel at least once.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r851190959-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1469","399323112","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/cd/2f/e8/asht007.jpg","1469","8","21","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asht007","Ashish Tiwari","636FAA93B7074C06BBCF6A1E1766C530",,"304555","Jaipur, India","Jaipur","asht007",,,,,,,,"Circular Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"Circular Road","Near Victory Tunnel","546044","11.668326","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","92.73637","Hotel Surya","286","3.2","49","35","63","82","57","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d546044-Reviews-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://hotelsuryashimla.com/"

"This is the  worst hotel amongst all the hotels i have stayed in.","1","2023-05","2023-05-30","Rating 1/5मैं किसी भी व्यक्ति को इस  होटल मे booking के लिए कभी भी recommend नही करूंगा ।
घटनाक्रम-
मैंने अपनी family के लिए केवल 2 दिन के लिए 2 rooms की hotel में booking थी। Family मे मेरा 2 साल का बच्चा और मेरे old aged parents भी शामिल थे। मैंने hotel पहुंचने से पहले call confirmation भी किया था किन्तु जब मैं अपनी family के स���थ hotel पहुंचा तब मुझसे बताया गया की आपकी booking cancle हो गई है क्योंकि आप 7 बजे के बाद hotel मे आए हैं। मैं बहुत परेशान हो गया की अब मैं पूरी family को लेकर कहा पर जाऊं और इस समय कौन सा hotel book करूं। मेरी wife ने hotel management से बहुत request की तब हमें बताया गया की अभी आपको केवल एक room ही मिल पाएगा, दूसरे room के लिए आपको wait करना पडेगा जब कोई room खाली होगा तभी दूसरा room आपको दे पाएंगे। मैंने family members से बात की तो वो भी इस बात पर सहमत हो गए। पहले तो मेरी booking मेरे से ही cancle करवाई गई, फिर एक बहुत छोटा सा room दिया गया, दूसरा room के लिए हम को रात के 10.00 बजे तक wait करना पड़ा।
Cons-1. hotel management  बहुत ही अमानवीय और irresponsible हैं जिसे केवल अपने स्वार्थ की पड़ी है ना कि अपने ग्राहक की। hotel management ने यही हरकत और भी ग्राहक के साथ की थी , की आपकी booking cancel हो गई हैं क्योंकि आप late aaye।
2.Rooms बहुत ही छोटे और unhygienic थे, जिसमे सीलन थी और मकरे (spider 🕷️🕸️)  भरे हुए थे। पहले दिन तो किसी तरह hotel staff से बोल कर spider 🕷️ 🕸️ को बाहर किया किंतु वो अगले दिन फिर से आ गए तब मैने ही spider 🕷️🕸️ को room से बाहर निकाला।
3. मैं 2 साल के बच्चे के साथ था और room ke bed के बगल में पूरा swich board खुला पड़ा था, electric ⚡ wires वहा से नीचे लटक रहें थे। 
4. Camod water 💦 bathroom में आ रहा था। जोकि बहुत ही unhygienic था।
5. Room का TV भी नही रीचार्ज था मैंने 3 से 4 बार house keeping को call किया किंतु उन्होंने TV रीचार्ज नहीं किया।
6. Room में केवल एक ही almirah दी गई थी, जिसमे hotel की 2extra beding रखी थी। जिससे हम almirah इस्तेमाल नहीं कर पाए।
7. Water motor हमारे ही room के उपर fit की गई थी जिसके वजह से रात के 5 बजे से ही हमारी नींद टूट गई।
Pros-
1. रेस्टोरेंट का खाना अच्छा है।","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r892734072-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,,,,,"2","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ammumomo","Amit","53FABEE6876A146A519FAA9AD79945B5",,"667805","Kanpur, India","Kanpur","ammumomo",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"

You make people wait outside and dont even let people enter the hotel if they by chance reach before checkin time. May I ask you one thing being in a hotel industry you must be aware of an early checkin rule right which can be availed by paying up some extra amount. Even if i consider that you dont had adequate rooms you dont have the necessary courtesy to ask people to wait inside.

"Unprofessional Management and Staff","2","2017-06","2017-07-21","1) Hotel has short way to reach Mall road but this way to Mall road is too steep that it becomes extremely difficult to reach Mall road and almost impossible for old aged and children to walk through this road and hotel is far from lift service area,

2) Hotel Management who is doing the booking are over smart and thinks customer to be fool once they receive payment they do not pay attention to customers complaints and do not keep their wordings. They are totally unprofessional having so attitude. Earlier my plan was two stay for 2 days but when I discussed with them after 2 days to extend my booking for 3rd day they deal in very unprofessional way as this was the peak season time of June and even told me to leave the room at once. They need to be professional and focus on their way of speaking.

Firstly Hotel Victory location is at Prime place nearest hotel to Railway Station , Old ISBT Victory Tunnel( iconic landmark of Shimla) on the Main Circular Road. Topography of Shimla is such that to reach Mall Road from main Circular road you have to climb stairs or road for at least 100 meters.
 Secondly you have mentioned that you had made booking for two days and after two days you told the Front office people to extend the booking for third night and they refused. 
 Sir, you had mentioned yourself that it was peak season time and extension of booking was not possible because of prior reservations for which Hotel management can't be blamed.","Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"
"Average Hotel","3","2017-05","2017-05-30","Located on main Cart Road. Hotel claims to have 100m from Mall. But the approach is very steep, not for old aged or kids and definitely more than 100m
The room rates are high compared to the facilities offered. Only good things are firstly there are bunk beds for two kids in a family room and secondly the view from front rooms is fantastic
The restaurant closes at 1030pm or so and thereafter it's not possible to get even a spoon!
Didn't have a medical kit also
Parking is limited to max 3-4 cars
Overall an average hotel with rates pretty high. Can be very good with just a little bit of more interest by the management","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r489170879-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"2084","646074042","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/82/4e/ba/samir-bedarkar.jpg","2084","15","102","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samir_bedarkar","Samir_bedarkar","CB9B8C5921BA9046D80BE0D7CC8F849E",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","Samir_bedarkar",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"
"It's a kind of lodge only.","3","2017-03","2017-03-13","I stayed in this hotel in Holi weekend and it was a family trip. We didn't get rooms booked in advance due to sudden plan and thought of finding a hotel on arrival. However, unfortunately we got late and arrived shimla at 8PM. We enquired this hotel and checked in as we didn't have much options due to station being packed fully. 

Pros: 
1. Though it was huge rush in shimla, the hotel didn't charge us premium as other hotels like brightland, rajdoot and cedar grand were doing. We were given room at nominal cost.
2. Located adjacent to Victory tunnel. So going to kufri was easier and so was to get out of city on check out.

3. Food was average but compared to quality of hotel and service, it was great.

4. Hot water was available. 
5. Payment accepted thru card but only partially and have to pay 3500 in cash also

Cons:
1. As explained, the hotel is not near mall road and one has to walk over 30 mins, on the slope to reach The Ridge. But can be walked, if you are young enough. Hotel is situated at distance of 4 kms from lift to mall road which is nearest place to reach mall road.

2. Very basic service: even in too cold nights, they do not provide heater with room and will charge 200 per night for each heater. This would be one wire heater and will not work much. Even they didn't work at first place and has to replaced multiple times. It seems they were switching it off centrally. 

Heaters were not having proper switches and were dangerous and could cause casualties.

3. No tea before 7:30AM. Nothing will be served after 10:30 PM. Even for water, had to call 3 times then walked to reception.

4. Standard size rooms are too small and hardly having any space to move around. Deluxe rooms were ok. Only towel and a soap in name of toiletries. Bed sheets were messy and not washed for last few years it seems. Even room was having spider net at few places. Seems never taken care.

5. No parking within hotel though paid parking is just opposite and is usually available.

Reviewing Avg bcoz of food and charges otherwise sleeping there was difficult  due to chilling nights and weak heating arrangements.

"Average Hotel","3","2016-09","2017-01-26","Let me start by giving the plus points for the hotel. it is located within walking distance of the railway station and there is a very steep shortcut from the hotel up to the Mall Road. When we checked in we were upgraded to a Classic Suite which we have to say was a lovely room.

Now for the bad points. The room was facing the main road and it is located very close to the Victory tunnel,there was constant honking of horns an blowing of police whistles. Plus the room was not far from the reception lobby and there was plenty of noise from emanating from there. To make matters worse, when we stayed, they had construction work in progress (hence room upgrade) which went on until 7:00pm and beyond.

There wasn't any hot water in the bathroom and despite numerous attempts to fix it we ended up having to use buckets provided by the kitchen. The wifi kept signing off all the time meaning we had to keep inputting the access code again and again and that was when we had a signal which was at times non existent in the room or lobby area.

I think I would choose somewhere else in Shimla.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r454967634-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"450","20702552","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/3b/e5/58/infoaddict.jpg","248","136","3656","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/infoaddict","infoaddict","554EED03445D9571E0F5D621528F23DB",,"186442","Anglesey, United Kingdom","Anglesey","infoaddict",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"

Breakfast buffet had no varieties as only thing which was offered was aloo puri and jam/butter toast with tea/coffee.

"pleasant stay","4","2017-09","2018-01-15","wonderful hotel which provides guests with a lift access to the mall road in shimla which is extremely important to have when visiting the location. staff at the hotel very friendly. I personally think its the hard work of its owner who was always available in the lobby and around the hotel giving instructions to his staff which i can say have really paid off as the hotel has maintained a standardized look to it which some hotels in shimla are far away from achieving. the security at the hotel is very good with security guard stationed at the gate as well as the rooftop mall access. Rooms are average i think a small upgrade to mondernise them can really help. during our check inn we were double charged on our card which was a obvious technical error only to realize it 1 hr later . we contacted the reception and they refunded our money back  in cash which we requested. overall a very good hotel for foreigners visiting shimla who would want a decent clean place to stay and also very good  place for families to stay at.

It doesn't have good food and WiFi is not free , so much fraud in price , if you have car you have to go to a parking because they don't have parking .

But to my surprise I found the actual tariff for the same room as displayed at the Hotel to be much lower than charged online. The discount turned out to be an disappointing. The standard room was dungeoned up in a corner. Couldnt stand it, had to immediately rush to book the supposed suite on offer. Which was comfortable enough but definitely not worth calling itself a suite. When asked about the deluxe room, found to be exactly identical to the suite. So please be ware, just for the pricing.
Food was good overall.
There is no parking space provided and hv to settle for the govt parking facility situated few hundred meters down( which charges around 200 bucks for a night).
The room was cosy enough and well decked, no toiletries in house except a tiny soap provided.. so go well stacked.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r391419344-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","15","189","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdeeshGo","AdeeshGo","17AA9808B164D70F401377F7984D7925",,,,,"AdeeshGo",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"

The Hotel is locaed very near the Victory tunnel and the Old Bus stand and Taxi stand. We took a Family suite on the 3rd floor. The room was front facing and the view was good. The bathroom was clean and had running hot and cold water. The first day was good. But suddenly in the late evening , a hoard of people ( all member of a Travel company) arrived. they left the next morning. Our second day stay was horrible. Soon after the afternoon , the Hot water taps went dry. By the time another hoard of passenger from another Tour party arrived , we had stored water in a bucket . The cold water taps also went dry. In the morning , there was no water . The Hotel gave a bucket of water ore leaving for SARAHAN. Overall , this hotel is used by Tour parties for lodging their travellers overnight.

"“Pleasant Hotel with Mesmerising view”","5","2016-05","2016-05-03","We had stayed in Hotel Victory on 1st May and can't wait to write review for it...It is well-maintained hotel to stay in Queen of Hills. View is outstanding and rooms are spacious and well maintained. Staff is nice and helpful. View of the valley in front is amazing.  Windows are large enough to savour the view and sunlight altogether. In the night, sight is breathtaking.
With all these beauties it is a budgeted hotel and I must say that on my next visit I’ll stay in this hotel only.

"Fraud Hotel ","1","2016-04","2016-04-28","I booked this hotel through goibibo but after reaching there i was not given the room that was shown in the picture on goibibo. After asking the reason the staff replied that this is the only room that goibibo guests get. The room that was given to me was pathetic, it was next to a servant quarter. Bedsheet stinks, bathroom   , floor everything dirty. I asked the staff to give me the room i actually booked after watching pictures but they refused. After offering for extra money they provided me the same room that i booked through goibibo at a price of extra ₹1200. I called goibibo but no help was done. So i upgraded. The room in which i was upgraded was even pathetic, dirty bed sheet, floor and again washroom stinks. The staff didn't know the meaning of hositality anyway. Rude staff. Pathetic food. Even this hotel is not situated near the mall, you need to walk too much to reach the mall or the ridge.

                         Greetings from Hotel Victory,Shimla. As you have mentioned in your review that the room provided to you was small and not up to the mark.  I would like to bring to your kind notice that you had made booking for Standard room (size 12’ by 12’) but after seeing the Super Deluxe Room (size 16’ by 14 feet) you told us to up grade it to that room. We told you that there is difference of Rs.1500/- per night for the Super Deluxe room as the Standard room was booked through Goibibo. You were not ready to pay the difference but seeing our business with Goibibo and relation with esteem guest we just charged Rs.600/- difference. If still you are not satisfied with our service I apologize for the same,as we try our level best to satisfy our guests. 
                       Our Restaurant renovation work was being carried out during your stay and you have sent the pictures of the repair work of chairs and sofas. Sir, in any hotel renovation is necessary hence furniture is scattered and there is mess so kindly consider our problem. Please visit again so that you can get changed atmosphere and better experience.

"Victory Hotel not recommended","1","2015-11","2015-11-30","We made OYO room booking and saw the big sign on the hotel for OYO rooms, so we stopped at the hotel.  The staff at the register was arrogant and unhelpful in helping us find the our actual OYO booking, which was few blocks from the hotel.  Hotels.com didn't provide us with the name of actual hotel where we made the booking.  Anyway, they refused to honor our hotels.com booking and charged Rs. 2000 for a room that has nice valley view but with filthy bathroom and poor old broken furniture.  Didn't provide shampoo, tea bags and not even hand towels.  The hotel is not on Mall roat, but they claim it is on Mall Road.  They show a small alley through the backdoor of hotel to go to Mall.  We basically took a big risk climbing that ride.  It can be fetal for those who are not used to mountain climbing.  I can not recommend this hotel to anyone, unless they reduce the price and improve the room quality and service.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r330084171-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","161769875","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/a4/69/93/ghanshyam-h.jpg","50","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gdh1955","gdh1955","410FCC8D7A5A067189B18607A8886315",,"43732","Columbus, Mississippi","Columbus","gdh1955",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"

"Filthy dirty standard rooms","1","2015-08","2015-09-19","I booked for a couple of days stay in this hotel..was initially impressed by the nice reviews and the pictures posted..And went ahead to book a standard room via cleartrip..
Very first thing about the hotel is its location.although mentioned that its on the mall road..its actually on the circular road and is far from the mall road.well theres a shortcut through a narrow dark lane by the gutter side that takes you up to one extreme end of the mall road..it might be a horrifying experience if you risk to take the same shortcut after evening.
then comes the standard room..curtains.bed sheet.pillows.towel..everythings stained and dirty..with windows that will open towards the garbage dumping area.looked at all the rooms.and all of them has the pungent smell of pee and the dampness of an isolated construction..
Finally we decided in an hour to upgrade to a deluxe room..well for a change the room had a nice view of the valley..and theres some renovation done with some good wood work that has probably taken away the smell and dampness..the bathrooms were standard with no geyser and no toiletries..
Next comes to the food which was average and nothing worth mentioning except the stained cutleries and teapots.
Coming to the management..they seemed very friendly and on request told us that they will book cabs for us for the sightseeing tour..later we booked the same tour with local drivers on the mall road at less than half the price..finally when we paid the room charges we had to pay the full price and not the discounted price thats available on various hotel booking websites..and that also in the off season..
A couple of advice for the readers
1)you will get rooms of far better quality in the mall road(actual mall road i mean) at a pretty low price
2)dont get swayed by the pictures..u will waste your money
3)even if you are still booking a room in the hotel do book a deluxe room and not a standard room
Pros: the place where the management sits is pretty nice and have got a good view.there is a lift available in the hotel..these are the only two good things in this hotel..well then how does it matter when you end up in filthy dirty rooms for staying","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r311849149-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","150724388","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/fb/df/24/subhadeep-s.jpg","50","4","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suvosehwag","subhadeep","E9BB97D9DD6A3FC9FEEEDB10C4DCB2DD",,"190511","Stavanger, Norway","Stavanger","suvosehwag",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"

Further, the hotel is quite expensive (Rs 4000/-) for the given set of amenities. I didn't tried food at the hotel, which was again costlier one. We ordered food from outside.

USP of this hotel is that, hotel lift directly takes you to mall road near kalibari. Direct consequence, we enjoyed  walk in mall road at 22:00 when it was almost empty.

The rooms are well maintained, food are tasty and priced little on higher side, service is available round the clock.

"Great location, good views","3","2017-04","2017-05-01","Main reasons why we chose Landmark
1) It had its own car parking. We were arriving by self-drive car and hence needed one
2) Its 6th floor opens onto mall road making it convenient to walk there

The rooms were clean and decently sized. All the rooms have one window from where you can see the valley. On the first night, we'd a room that was facing the mall road. Exhausted from travelling and a day full of sightseeing, we were looking forward to an early night. Unfortunately, there was a severe monkey menace late into the night with a group of monkeys screaming, fighting right outside the window over the hotel's shed. We called the reception multiple times and they attempted to shoo them away. There are no guarantees and these kinds of things happen here was the response from the hotel. Fortunately for us, the last shooing did work and we were able to sleep around 12:00. The next day we were shifted to a full valley facing room and that does not have this issue. We did speak to the manager as well. He assured that this is not a regular feature but they're aware of the problem. They are looking at measures to curb it but have no permission to put up nets or shades. So if booking, would highly recommend that you avoid these sets of rooms. 

The location is perfect as it is a driveable hotel that also opens up right onto mall road ( a few minutes walk). The breakfast was okayish. Quality could be improved.  

Would recommend this if you need car parking and need to be close to the mall road. If you're not arriving in your own car, then there are many other options more reasonably priced and with similar or better proximity to mall road.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r480770246-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452391968","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","1200","22","55","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerBT","TravellerBT","2C23A68F8FC984EBB76DFFF6BA931F71",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","TravellerBT",,,,,,,,"The Mall Near Gorton Castle Square, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"The Mall","Near Gorton Castle Square","1405599","31.105461","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16361","Hotel Landmark","421","3.8","25","28","74","173","121","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1405599-Reviews-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotellandmarkshimla.com/"

"Overpriced","3","2017-04","2017-04-01","We stayed in landmark for one day as we were near to Shimla. The reviews had us belive that the hotel has amazing views and this was the primary reason we booked the hotel (at a 3 star price). Our room (supposedly a family room) faced a road and some dirty shacks and hence we were disappointed as soon as we entered our rooms. Our request for a better view room was declined due to availability constraints. 
The room and breakfast were as per expectations. The hotel has a covered parking which is a rarity in Shimla and the lift takes you to a spot which is a 10 minute walk from Mall road. Overall our experience was pretty average considering the price we paid (in an off-season).

"Nice property with direct access to Mall Road","4","2019-03","2019-04-16","If you are commuting by bus, the hotel is at a walking distance from the Victory Tunnel. We reached around 6:30 in the morning and an early check-in was provided without any extra cost. However, we had to wait for over an hour as rooms were not available.
During the wait, we sat at the reception but there was a foul smell coming from the toilet there, for which it was a bit uncomfortable. About the rooms, they were clean enough, 24x7 running hot water. Room service was also good. The best thing about the hotel is you get direct access to the Mall Road, however, you have to walk a bit. Few toiletries, like moisturiser, shampoo were not available at first, but they were provided once we asked for the same. The food at the restaurant is also good.
The outside of the hotel needs some repairs hence don't go by its looks; otherwise, everything was good.

Service is pathetic, called up atleast 10 times for extra plates and cutlery but no response, finally I had to walk up to the kitchen and request. Asked for an extra mattress for the 3rd person and they just simply provided a single mattress on the floor, imagine someone had to sleep literally on the floor in the cold weather of January.

The only drawback that was there was we were 4 pax and the room given to us was not suitable for 4 pax instead was for 3, however when we complained to the hotel management next morning they felt sorry for that and said if we would have complained last night they would have got the room changed.

The receptionist told me that mall road is 2 mins walk but it was a lie, takes atleast 15 mins. The deluxe room is pathetic, there is no ventilation and it is as small as your bathroom.

I called in the evening and their room service did not have fries, peanuts or even tandoori chicken. All he could give was chilly chicken, this is Shimla and not some village in Leh.

"Bad view, bad location, terrible food, pathetic service. AVOID!","1","2015-12","2015-12-17","I had planned a stay for 2 days in shimla, booked this hotel for day 1 just to ensure everything was alright in the hotel. It was so bad and i thank my stars i did not book and pay  for the second day in advance.
I had to shift to another hotel and feel lucky to have not paid for 2 days in advance. The rooms stink, the deluxe room did not have every a tiny window for air circulation nor did the bathroom have an exhaust.Requested them for another room but he said no room is available, liar he was when i went out to check that all rooms were empty.

 The parking is very far from this place and you have to walk a lot to reach this place so is the mall road, the reception person will tell you its just 2 min walk just add 0 after 2 then i guess he will be correct.

 Coming to the food and service, the menu had a variety of more than 100 things listed and out of which i could only order a couple of things, as some were not available and some could not be made for example tandoori items. Tea is horrible and so is the service. 

STAY AWAY from this hotel, live on a footpath than this hotel atleast you will not die of suffocation as in this hotel's so called ""Deluxe"" rooms.

Restaurant was going through renovation. Only room service available with a limited menu option, but it was tasty.

Service is generally poor; Had to ask for everything twice (for e.g. towels); Toiletries was not replaced at all.
The cleaning staff by mistake kept the bathroom door and window open when we had gone out. Monkey(s) came in and tore some of our luggage.

At the time of booking the owner of hotel promised all sorts of things including pick and drop to Mall road, good facility for parking and driver.
But the reality turned out to be completely different. Our car was denied entry on the road citing the reason it was a VIP road and parking can only be done after 8'o clock in the night. Since the car cannot be parked before 8 PM and must leave before 7 AM, hence the driver needs to be accommodated accordingly. On top of that, hotel staff misbehaved badly.

"Superb service, Great food & Comfortable stay in heart of Shimla","4","2013-12","2013-12-26","Hi,

First of all I'm completely disagree with rahulgoyal's review. I've stayed at this place with my wife for 4 nights from 21st Dec, 2013 to 24th Dec, 2013 in a super deluxe room and found their service as excellent and really value for money. Rooms were a bit cozy but properly lit naturally due to 3 valley facing windows. If we talk about the room service, It was very fast, supportive and efficient. I would like to appraise Rahul Negi (one of the service staff) for his extended support as well as others too.

As much as location is concerned, it is well situated not much near nor far from ridge, which makes it easily reachable as well as quite. Actually I enjoyed late evening 5 minute walk between mall road and hotel almost daily.

One of the most adorable thing I found during my stay was complimentary pick-up and drop by hotel owner's own car for which I'm very much thankful to Mr. Kukreja & family. They've not only provided me free transportation but waived off heater charges (around 1,200 for 4 nights) too, as it was very cold due to snow-fall on my arrival night. 

Other than it, I would like to tell you one more thing. I was carrying very less cash and relied over my credit card, but, hotel didn't have a card swipe machine. But, it didn't caused me any problem as they arranged to get it paid by a terminal at their own shop in lift road.

I was total stranger to Shimla or the hotel management, but they treated me as I was their personal guest rather than a customer. We feel very touched by their behaviour and will always suggest my near and dear ones visiting Shimla to stay with them.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1009876-r188550392-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","104314814","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/37/b7/be/rsjaiswal.jpg","50","4","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsjaiswal","Ravi Shankar J","C2ACE1118C94DF10D22D4176770A71D7",,,,,"rsjaiswal",,,,,,,,"The Ridge Near Christ Church, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"The Ridge","Near Christ Church","1009876","31.10133","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17907","Hotel Shiwalik Regency","84","3.1","25","6","14","12","27","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1009876-Reviews-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://hotelshiwalikregency.business.site/?m=true"

"A reasonably comfortable, but expensive, stay in Simla","3","2013-08","2013-09-30","e stayed here after arriving in Simla late in the evening, on the night of Eid, to find all the hotels of the town fully booked! After an hours fruitless searching around town, we were led here by a hotel tout, and finally found a couple of rooms. Predictably expensive at 2,500/- per room per night, as the management knew that they had us over a barrel, and had no alternative; the rooms were reasonably clean, comfortable, and well appointed with small balconies (as in all of Simla, be very careful to keep the windows and door closed, or you will receive an unwanted visit from the local monkeys, who will break in and trash your room, if you give them a chance!!). The staff were fairly pleasant and helpful. There is no hotel restaurant, but they will serve meals in the room. It's about a ten to fifteen minute walk uphill from the Mall, and is in a quiet area. 
Overall, it's not a bad hotel, but there are much better value establishments in Simla, and much nearer to the centre, so I wouldn't bother to stay here again, except in another dire emergency.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1009876-r179250754-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"80","77598326","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/a0/0e/76/hugharayner.jpg","77","21","18","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HughAR","HughAR","7615BD68AE35564BC04427429457BB9E",,,,,"HughAR",,,,,,,,"The Ridge Near Christ Church, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"The Ridge","Near Christ Church","1009876","31.10133","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17907","Hotel Shiwalik Regency","84","3.1","25","6","14","12","27","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1009876-Reviews-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://hotelshiwalikregency.business.site/?m=true"

I am not sure why this hotel given 2 star rating and good feedbacks. All i have gone through was total fraud and worst services been offered by this hotel. Dont believe any of the offerrings of this hotel cuz none is there and you might be shocked when you stay at this hotel. From the moment of entering this hotel, it looks like 'gareeb labour' class hotel who's management is only after your money. Check out the water geyser avaialability cuz the management has hidden switches for all geysers and they will switch it off in few minutes.Rooms are dirty and smelling with stain marks on bed sheets and pilows. warm blankets are having holes in them and ridden with bugs and smelling so badly and nauseating. Rooms are dirty and nobody cares to clean them during your stay.there might be people actually sleeping on stairs and galleries and you can hear loud noises from them. beware if they provide you any room with bath tub then you can be sure that they wont allow you to fill it with warm water from the geyser.total loss for money and you will end up your hollidays in frustation and anger that you were fooled on all fronts in this hotel. again the hotel manager will force you to ake his tour package and you can be sure that it will be many folds costly then others.
I booked this hotel after seeing so many good feed backs from customers but it looks like that they are all posted by proxies and i am sure that the star rating of this hotel is suspicious as it is in no way near to even a single star , leave alone 2 stars. looks like its due to these travel site conniving with the hotel management to sell and rob this cheap and filthy hotel to the innocent customers.I booked this hotel for 4 days for my stay in shimla but i cancelled my stay in just 2 days and left this hotel as soon as posible as i can to avoid bad smell and tricksters management and also to keep myself safe from whole lot of crowd which dwell this hotel and can be seen sleeping. i only want to advise my fellow travellers so that they are not trapped and robbed the way i suffered.DONT BELIEVE ANY OF THE STAKES AND CLAIMS OF THE HOTEL AND THE WEBSITES OFFERING THIS HOTEL.DONT BE FOOLED BY SUPER DELUX OR DELUX ROOMS RATINGS CUZ THESE ARE THERE TO FOOL YOU AND WHAT YOU WILL GET IS ONLY SMELLY AND DIRTY ROOM.

"fungus, muck and monkeys","1","2012-05","2012-05-21","terrible! that's the word. We were forced to hole up here because we landed on a saturday night from our way back from Kalpa without a booking and the entire city was packed, and had to take up the only available ""family suit"" for four of us. To begin with, the loo was not cleaned since the last use and the flush wasn't working. Even after repeated requests to get the loo cleaned, it did not happen. The room was cramped and smelled musty and bad. One of us started sneezing ten minutes into the room. All the blankets were damp and smelled of fungus. The water they provided in the room was a grey muck with particles floating. We had to scream at one waiter for 15 minutes before he changed the water, but not with something of substantially better quality. 
At night when we went out for dinner, we'd left the keys in the reception, and asked them to clean the loo. They did not do that, but went into our room, left couple of fresh towels and left the keys dangling from the door - with all our valuables in the room. 
In the morning the balcony door was open and a monkey leaped in and sat on our bed! We had to scare him away with a stick.
The phone wasn't working either.
Most of all the staff was rude and unresponsive.
Take this hotel only if its your last resort!
And ya - the only view it offers is that of a parking space.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1009876-r130337150-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"412","41610250","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/7a/ec/0a/rajdeep-1986.jpg","550","16","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rajdeep_1986","Rajdeep B","9FE47C9A1781ED8DACC825551B760040",,"294265","Singapore, Singapore","Singapore","Rajdeep_1986",,,,,,,,"The Ridge Near Christ Church, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"The Ridge","Near Christ Church","1009876","31.10133","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17907","Hotel Shiwalik Regency","84","3.1","25","6","14","12","27","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1009876-Reviews-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://hotelshiwalikregency.business.site/?m=true"

"Good hotel at a good location with respect to Mall & Ridge","4","2010-12","2011-01-06","First of all, keep this in mind that hotels in Shimla are costly. Rooms claimed to be super delux by a hotel is actually just a good room. During peak season if tariff of a room is anything above Rs 2000, you can assume that it will be a good room. But nothing great. Rooms under Rs 1500 (if any) can be the ones at the backside of the hotel and a bit suffocating. Also remember if you are staying at Mall or above ridge, then cars can charge additional Rs 200-300 to pick you up from hotel (that is only if car is allowed in front of your hotel).

Hotel Shiwalik Regency is located a bit higher than the Christ Church (and Ridge). To reach this hotel from Ridge, you need to walk uphill for 10min, while coming down to Ridge is obviously faster and easier. The location is quite peaceful near the jakhu road. Jakhu will be few minutes from this hotel by car. Overall stay in the hotel was pleasant. The staff is courteous and the managers are helpful. Room was clean with a nice attached bathroom (with a bathtub). We took a super delux room and hence the room was on the front side with a balcony giving a view of the valley. Though the room could have been a bit larger, but it is actually just ok for 2 people. The view might not be great, but it's not bad either. Try to take a room on the top most two floors to get a better view of the valley. Monkeys may sometimes pass through your balcony, but that's a common phenomenon in Shimla. Food is served at the room. The food is good and not costly. If you book car from this hotel, you may get a bit discount from the market price. 

Reaching the hotel from bus stand / taxi stand / station can be a bit tedious if you decide to walk. A car will take Rs 350 to drop you at the hotel from station.

Govt employees should try to book Hotel Grand. It is wonderfully located at Kali Temple Rd. Its so near from The Mall and Ridge, but yet so peacefully located. Though I don't know how the facilities are there.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1009876-r91942432-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"388","223764658","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/56/60/b2/avishekt.jpg","388","22","51","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvishekT","avishek t","AF4051350F9FFE74C8CCA88B8534FB55",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","AvishekT",,,,,,,,"The Ridge Near Christ Church, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"The Ridge","Near Christ Church","1009876","31.10133","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17907","Hotel Shiwalik Regency","84","3.1","25","6","14","12","27","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1009876-Reviews-Hotel_Shiwalik_Regency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://hotelshiwalikregency.business.site/?m=true"

A lift up to the top floor presents you with an exit out of the back of the hotel from which it is only a 5 minute walk to Mall Road. Be aware though, there are steep steps and it is an uphill walk.

Only real negative is that there is no heating in the room. If you go in the colder months (we went in March) it very cold in the room.

"AVOID!!!!!!!","1","2018-04","2018-04-04","This hotel is overpriced for what it offers. 

Can’t think of many positive things to say, so here are the negatives. 

Service was slow

Rooms are dirty

No bar (May no be important to some, but it was to me)

Dead flies on my bed.

Hot water started off cold and I had to leave it running for 15 minutes before it heated up.

Lock to the bathroom was broken, and no shower curtain which meant the water splashed everywhere. 

Taps and shower fittings falling apart.

Definitely a zero star hotel.

I would say, avoid this place altogether.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r571162604-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"880","798025587","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/90/e7/73/jolly-jagga.jpg","880","6","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolly_jagga","Jag Singh","B21DFC05BE289E32019BABC6ABD688DE",,"580420","Ilford, United Kingdom","Ilford","Jolly_jagga",,"Public Relations Manager","606932397","en","2018-08-15","","Dear guest, Thanks for feedback we are sorry for any inconvenience if faced during stay.We would like to welcome you again whenever you visit Shimla.

This facility has solar water heater but it takes 15 minutes for you to get reasonably hot water and there is no hair dryer available. Food is very average and we were served same buffet menu on all three mornings. Wifi connection is very poor and we did not have connection on 8th Feb and on the day of check out.There is no view what so ever from the rooms.Pricing is too steep for the quality on offer.

"Disgusting Rooms, Awful Customer Service. Hotel Description Needs Updating","1","2017-11","2017-11-24","After reading reviews on TA, we thought we were going to be in for a treat staying here but after a 10hr drive from Delhi, how wrong were we?
We had booked a so called ""deluxe"" room, checked in and up to our room, it was already dark, so cannot comment on the views.
The room is disgusting, looked liked it had not been used for weeks, the blanket in the cupboard looked like it had never been cleaned.
We run the hot water and waited and waited for hot water, but nothing.  We call reception who advise that the water is solar powered so if the hot water is used during the day then there is no hot water.
I go down to reception and ask to upgrade our room at which he says we can upgrade to the honeymoon suite at an extra cost of 3,000 rupees per night.  So off we go, this is supposed to be the best room in the hotel, really?  Obviously there is no hot water, the room is larger but you do get the benefits of large black ants, and not just one, I am sure there was an army of ants.
We book straight away into somewhere else (another review), back to reception and advise them we are leaving.  He asks what is wrong and we explain, no apology or anything, no mention of any refund or anything.  Please do not stay here unless you want to ruin your holiday.  We booked this through Hotwire who gave us a refund as they escalated our concerns to the review team, who must have agreed that we should have been informed of the lack of hot water.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r542945008-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"480","716636018","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/b6/ff/72/sunnyp7272.jpg","480","350","796","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyP7272","Sunny P","7AB7AA9B6AF5CA5A121BC713F8D18BF1",,"186216","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","SunnyP7272",,"Public Relations Manager","606951625","en","2018-08-16","","Dear guest, Thanks for feedback we are sorry for any inconvenience if faced during stay.We would like to welcome you again whenever you visit Shimla.

Hotel Landmark is the worst. Very smelly and noisy rooms. old damaged interior like low class guest house. Food was in breakfast was costly against quality, cost is 5 star but quality and qty is 2nd class.
When I told for checkout then they want I leave the room in 10 minutes at sharp 12 o'clock. 
I think they understand the customer will not came again. waow.....
So guys don't cheat by him. check another option. 

 I shift next day to another good hotel due to unbearable smell from bathroom to room  at only 60% cost with very good room and service.

"A great place to stay and view the great Himalayas and lush green pine valley","4","2016-12","2017-03-15","- Panoramic, heavenly view of the Himalayas and the whole valley from the corner valley view room (404/504) . We had views from 3 sides of our room - completely justifying the additional tariff of the rooms. Seating at the sofas at our room we were stunned to witness the dramatic changes of colors at the 7-10 peaks of the Himalayas and the lush greens of gigantic Pines during the sunrise and sunset . I am sure this hotel is one of the top contenders for the best views from room in Shimla.
 
- The co-operation of Mr. Paban, GM of the hotel for holding our booking for extra 12 days to get the required reservation money deposited after I reach to Kolkata from Dhaka. 

- The services and the hospitality of Mr. Devinder Singh at the breakfast buffet was excellent and very welcoming. He was attentive to all the guests at every table in the restaurant, but was not at all intruding. He also encouraged my son and my mother to try out different items available from different parts of India. 
- Driver Mr. Suresh Kumer was very well behaved and drove us very safely every time we travel during our 4 days trip in Shimla-Kullu-Manali. 
- The Chinese dishes like fried rice, chilly chicken, soups were excellent. Also a good variety of cuisines besides Punjabi dishes are available through room services. 

-The location of the Hotel - very convenient for child/elderly travelers. 

- Car rental is a bit expensive, but reconcilable if you are travelling with Child and elderly guests.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r467484923-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452391659","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg","1200","7","47","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AaronPupul","Aaron S","A20128572D55F393F0D49D3FDF3EABC2",,"293936","Dhaka City, Bangladesh","Dhaka City","AaronPupul",,,,,,,,"The Mall Near Gorton Castle Square, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"The Mall","Near Gorton Castle Square","1405599","31.105461","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16361","Hotel Landmark","421","3.8","25","28","74","173","121","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1405599-Reviews-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotellandmarkshimla.com/"

"Nicely located hotel with ample parking","4","2017-01","2017-02-25","Visited hotel on republic day weekend in Jan-17 and hotel was all booked. Hotel is very nicely located i.e. hotel lift connects to the mall road although one has to walk to the main mall road (with shops) for ~1km which is inclined too. There is no transport and one has to walk only but you will get PRAM for baby in 150rs which you can return by calling the PRAM owners and they will collect from hotel itself. 

We were given rooms at 5th floor and one room had valley view which was excellent and another room was family room with one double bed & 1 bunker bed. Room size is average and basic amenities were there. Food was little expensive (In-room dining) like veg maggi costed ~Rs. 90. however food taste was good. Buffet breakfast was also tasty, though with limited variety 

Hotel staff was also courteous including the restaurant staff. We hired taxi to visit Jakhoo temple, Kufri instead of driving by own and which I think was the wisest decision we made. Lot of parking issues in Shimla & also risky driving so local sight-seeing is preferred via TAXI instead of own car. A full day taxi for local sight-seeing including Jakhoo, Kufri charged 1700 rs. 

Overall recommend this hotel for family, couples and all sorts of travelers.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1405599-r462825527-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"576","186462957","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/1d/32/ed/shashilpi.jpg","864","12","26","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shashilpi","Shashilpi","E07246F7435866616DC7716ADFFF8A7F",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","Shashilpi",,,,,,,,"The Mall Near Gorton Castle Square, Shimla 171003 India","Shimla","India","171003",,"The Mall","Near Gorton Castle Square","1405599","31.105461","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16361","Hotel Landmark","421","3.8","25","28","74","173","121","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1405599-Reviews-Hotel_Landmark-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotellandmarkshimla.com/"

As you had mentioned in your review that there was no hot water and you had to wait for three hours for hot water, I can understand your problem but at the time of check in you were informed regarding the hot water supply from our centralized system was closed for two hours because of major renovation of top floor bathrooms. Though we provided you hot water through buckets for that period. 2) You had mentioned that that there was darkness in restaurant and maintenance work was going on. Practically it’s not possible to serve food in the restaurant, which is under renovation.
Please try to understand that renovation/maintenance is necessary for the comfort of our esteem guests.

The suite is pretty clean and in good condition too. It's a 15 minute walk to the mall road. The food though is not that great.

3. Good staff
Cons:
1. Creaky bed

"Good Stay","4","2017-01","2017-01-30","This hotel is very near to victory tunnel where HPTDC buses have there pick up and drop.
This is very convenient if you are travelling by HPTDC Volvo.
Pros:
1. Good Service. Reception people specially Lalit and Gaurav are very helpful.
They provided an early check in as well.
2. Breakfast is good.
3. Location is good. Mallroad is near from hotels back side and that is a good way to reach mall road. There are no hotels on main mall road so you have to walk from any hotel. This was very good option.
4. Complimentary heater.
5. Ask for a room with View, hotel has good views.

Cons:
1. Food other than breakfast is not good, its pocket friendly though.
2. Deluxe rooms are small, interiors are good but washrooms are not good.
3. Luxury rooms are big, interiors are not good but washrooms are renovated.
4. Room service is bit lazy.

Overall a good stay.

"Worst hotel ever stayed in.","1","2017-01","2017-01-11","Worst hotel i have ever seen. Rude attitude of the reception staff and the manager.

SERVICE:
Call them more than 3 times for any service you need. And when you complaint to them, they will reply that sometimes it happens. 
Heater they provided was small one and one of the rod of the heater was not working. They replaced it after one day.

Not all rooms are accessible via lift. You have to take stairs for some rooms.

FOOD: 
Very bad quality of food.
In there breakfast menu they have fixed options:
Paranthas, Chhole/Aalu, Bhature, sandwich, poha, cornflakes, milk(90% water).
No Non-veg options available.
And the quality of food was very poor.

Stayed there for 3 nights and had a conversation with 3 families. Everybody had the same problem with them. Poor Service and Food.

Its better dont go for this hotel. And if you still want to go for this hotel dont go for breakfast option. Because you will get far better options to eat on mall road.

Speaking of mall road. Everybody wrote that they have easy access to the mall road. MALL ROAD FAR AWAY FROM THE HOTEL.

From the 9th Floor they have stairs (60-65) that will take you to the back of KALIBARI road. Then you walk 60-80 meters towards Kalibari road. Krom Kalibari road to the mall road is a steep road. So its a task reaching the mall road. But It is a good thing when you are returning from the mall road. And then again you have to go down the stairs to the hotel and at night there is a problem with light. And in day time monkeys surround the stairs.

They provide TEA/COFFEE maker. This is the first hotel i have ever seen that dont serve coffee. They just have tea bags. And whenever the hotel provides tea/coffee maker, they give you 1 liter seal packed water bottle. But this hotel will provide you water in the jug.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r451184201-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"706","440063346","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/3a/d5/72/pulkit93.jpg","706","14","58","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pulkit93","pulkit93","D9AA4E2A41F826DE02C277F32DEF4534",,"297602","National Capital Territory of Delhi, India","National Capital Territory of Delhi","pulkit93",,"Manager","472879945","en","2017-04-05","","Dear Sir,

We had booked through ibibo and later requested for an extra bed in the room. The request and the booking was executed quickly by the front desk staff. The bathroom was clean and tidy with basic amenities provided. The room also had a heater. We had dinner at the hotel and it was decently proportioned with good taste.

Heartfelt apologies for the discomfort you faced during your stay.

Please note a few points and consider the same as a justification from our side:
1). As you have mentioned in your review that you had made booking through Travel agent Rakesh.
 2). We have three types of rooms Standard,Super Deluxe and Classic Suite with tariff of Rs.2114/-, Rs.3288/- and Rs.4462/- respectively.
3)As the booking was done for standard room by the Travel Agent,Rakesh and he had charged for Super Deluxe room from you.
4) You had made total payment to Travel Agent Rakesh who had made the booking and not to us.
   
Please consider that with no fault of ours,you are blaming the hotel management.

There have also been things that we have gone out of the way to do which unfortunately have gone unnoticed, like providing you Extra beds complimentary etc.

We are dealing with the issue you raised regarding the service. it was a very busy weekend when you stayed but of course that doesn’t mean that our service should have faltered in anyway. I do apologize about this and will do whatever I can to ensure it is not repeated in future.

"Great rooms, location and price","5","2014-08","2014-08-19","We had gone to Shimla on 14th August by our own vehichle with my friends and family, the guides out there misguided us by showing us hotels which were extremely overpriced (as it was extended weekend). I on my own started to look for rooms in various hotels. I went to Hotel Victory and they were providing rooms for family only.I told the front office person that the guides were misguiding us and I have come on my own and my friends and family are waiting in the vehicles. He showed me super deluxe rooms and the rate was displayed at the reception Rs.3200/- I was more than happy to see the rooms and the tariff compared to other hotels. I immediately made the advance payment and booked three rooms.
It was a great experience; Hotel Victory was much beyond our expectations. 
 It’s very near to the Railway parking and Mall Road. Great ambiance and very well done modern rooms and amenities. The view from rooms is great and you get to see the valley.
Food and service was  good, The location is very good, if you drive down to Shimla its just at the entrance of main Shimla (right at the beginning of market) so you save on driving on congested roads, if you are not driving then also you are very near to the Railway station and taxi stand.
We were not able to find any negative points. It was a great experience, and every penny spent was worth more than it.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r222833914-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452392461","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/surajnanda","surajnanda","1492552BFDFDD6D0F4DA28986ED10E0F",,,,,"surajnanda",,"Owner","223573178","en","2014-08-22","shanty068","Dear Sir,

1. Torn dirty bedsheets
2. Bad smelling dirty blankets. When i opened blanket it had hair stuck over it.
3. Poor quality food, tea tastes like yuck.
4.highly non curious staff
5. Hotel is next to victory tunnel n there is lot of traffic sound, honking all time.
6. Rooms are not having fans if u feel hot in blanket u hv to choice.

Pls don't go by positive reviews about this hotel. They are a disaster n not at all value for money.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r222596074-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452361217","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg","1200","3","20","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NitinLoomba","Nitin L","A251133758383DEABC48646B4F0F9CC7",,,,,"NitinLoomba",,"Guest Relations Manager","223572539","en","2014-08-22","shanty068","This review is totally fake and false. First of all the room which shown is  not of Hotel Victory. Secondly in Shimla there are very few hotels which have ceiling fans and there are wall mount or pedestal fans which are provided to  the customers (as fans are very rarely required) .
As you had mentioned about the food you just had two cups of milk tea and two cups of tea on your two days stay, so please do not give reviews about food which was not tried by you. 
                
You had stayed in  Front side room after trying several hotels,for which the rate we were charging was 2800/- plus 17.42% tax ( Rs.3288/-) as you were asking for discount I told you that this is peak season time and we are not offering any discount for this period . At the time of check out also you asked me for discount. I told you that I am sorry that no discount is offered to any guest and you told me Ab discount na dene ka natija dekhna.

                   It’s my humble request to you not to post such kind of fake and revenge reviews because that you were not offered any discount
 
It is sad that hotel owners/managers have to suffer because currently it seems like the customer has the right to say anything and the hotel owner or management cannot do anything to defend or put the matter right. It’s my request to trip advisor team also to please see the authentication of the review.

like everyone said , the manager of this hotel is bigger turn off than the hotel itself.  he is so so snobbish and rude. 
the only reason we stayed in this tacky place was non availability of,rooms,anywhere else. 
highly overpriced and super noisy.... they standard rooms are no better than a store room so we preffered to stay in super delux room which was so shabby,noisy and unhygenic.
they staff is super rude and misbehaving. they dont even,ask for permission,before entering the room.
bedsheeta were torn, towels were dirty, ni hot water supply, super noisy.,i was feeling like i am sleeping on road, no ventilation.
plz dony waste ur,money in this shabby place. even if u dont get any place to stay go to. solan or kufri or may be come,back home but dont stay here.

Rude staff, filthy rooms with an age old tiny television that keeps flickering. Extremely bad and depressing lighting. We were given the supposedly 'Super Deluxe' room by GoIbibo. There was nothing remotely deluxe about the place which cost us almost Rs4000. Staff were very discourteous and charging sky rocketing prices to  customers coming in and enquiring about room availability as it was a long weekend. The food too was disappointed and not worth the price. Would not recommend it to anyone! The single plus I can think of is undoubtedly the location.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r222535708-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","107869215","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/6d/f4/1f/vyassreenivas.jpg","50","8","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vyassreenivas","vyassreenivas","96A9F4F0AB02E42532B6C965D6AA00AB",,,,,"vyassreenivas",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"
"Third class experience","2","2014-07","2014-07-24","The management of the hotel.is really bad. I went to shimla in june and had to.change the hotel after just 1night stay. 
The reason being that we were 6 friends and after thoroughly checking with the hotel for accomodation capacity in the.family suite we booked it. After reaching there after hours of travelling the manager outrightedly refused to let 6 people stay in the room saying it wad just for 4. Snobbery was quite an issue. After pleading with him for around half an hour did he let us stay in the room after charging us more for it. 
The pro of the hotel is that the rooms are nice and well furnished. And that is.it.
It is quite a long walk from the mall road.
When asking about local sightseeing places the manager seemed least interested in giving a reply back and went.on totally ignoring us. Book it only if it is your last option.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r217193940-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","145466936","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/ab/a6/38/utkarsh1411.jpg","50","0","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Utkarsh1411","Utkarsh1411","EE7A9F8EA518E7A9C11ABA052114C66B",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Utkarsh1411",,"Public Relations Manager","223559009","en","2014-08-22","shanty068","To this I would like to say that how can six persons can be allowed to stay in a four bedded room.

We reached early in the morning by Volvo and the stop was near Hotel Victory so I tried for rooms in the hotel and there were no rooms available in the hotel . I requested the receptionist to make my parents sit in the restaurant and I could search for rooms in another hotels. He was very helpful, made my parents sit in the restaurant and told me that rooms will be available after 9am. There were roadside guides following us told me that they could provide me good rooms. As I was not aware of Shimla I went with Road side guides to various hotels. Though rooms ware available in many hotels but the hotels rooms were no good and quite expensive. I went back to Hotel Victory after two hours of searching around and eventually I got a room at 10 am 
  This is a nice centrally located hotel. The rooms are well furnished. we stayed in Classic Suite (Room No.110)  The size of the room was  quite large to accommodate four persons comfortably we were pampered with their service.

This gives it the advantage of being close to the main market and Railway Station on the main circular road.   The rooms were very large & spacious with wooden flooring and excellent view. The best part was undoubtedly the hot  water available round the clock ( as they have solar and boiler system) which enabled us to take shower as many times as we felt like.

"Noisy...Feels like living on a highway","3","2013-09","2013-09-18","We stayed in this hotel for couple of days. It was a average stay to say the least.

Positives :
1. Situated near to the Mall Road.
2. Staff is very patient and helpful
3. Food is good and reasonably Priced.

Deltas :
1. Room Quality is not very good. The room size is good but it wont give you a luxury hotel feeling. I dont know why they termed the room as Super deluxe.
2. Situated right next to a red light, you will be hearing the honking of the cars and buses throughout day and night. Very noisy.
3. The manager seemed disinterested in helping or providing any guidance. You had to ask the support staff or step out of the hotel to find any sort of help and guidance.
4. The bedding was as hard as rock. They cleaned the room but didnt change the mattresses. On asking they replied we dont change mattresses so frequently. Strange.

Stay here only if you are looking for a budget hotel.

"Please read this review before selecting this hotel.","1","2013-04","2013-04-16","Please read other poor and terrible reviews and you will find many similarity. Reached shimla on April 13th 2013 with wife. The vendors will pull you to see the room. Rooms are okay. Bathroom are not well managed. drain pipes are visible in wash rooms. They will ask you for Rs 2000/- plus for one night stay. Bargain well. It is not worth 1200/- when you book with local vendor. We paid Rs.1800/- per night
Important- they have link with a local tour company just below their hotel named ""SWASTIK TRAVELS"" PREVIOSULY ""KANWAR TRAVEL"".  The hotel staff will try his best to book a cab through him and will assure you of best rates. They will charge you Rs 2500/- for TATAPANI trip and Rs.2500/- for local sight seeing. BEWARE- tatpani trip cost only Rs.1200/- and local sight seeing Rs.600/- may go up to only Rs.900/- for all sight seeing.  DONOT BUY TRAVEL PACKAGE FROM THEM.  Go to MALL road and you will find various taxi service people offering you reasonable service
After returing from first trip and felt cheated, we said no for other trip. The travel agency people called us down to fight. But dont get afraid slap them as I did. If sistuation worsen call police from MALL ROAD. They will support you. Hotel and travel agency both belong to one family.  DONOT BOOK THIS HOTEL. Instead move to mall road and you can find various hotels with in your budget and with great view.
Hotel will tell you that MALL ROAD is only 100 meter from their hotel from back side. But just it once. It is dangereous and frightfull in night.

"A good for Budget Stay with good Good and Coffee","3","2013-02","2013-02-19","We reached Shimla on 3rd Feb at around 8pm Starting our North India tour (delayed 4-6 hrs by train delay). We searched hotel with help of drivers and then few portals took us here.
Being off-season, I did not expect hotels to be costly, but centrally heated were very costly due to bad weather.
Hotel Victory is Budget Hotel, Not centrally heated. Also, they do not have good Rod-Heaters, so better have a drink to heat yourself up.
We were two couples and stayed for 2 days and paid 1526 each day. Later we had known that it would have been still cheap (may be 1200) if we had bargained.
Hotel Staff were decent except one overlooker waiter, who overlooked room very much whenever he visited us.
Beds are comfortable.
There are no white lights in hotel, all of them yellow.
The toilet and bathroom were well maintained and there was NO un-pleasent smell.

The food we were served was marvelous and we did not had to worry about breakfast and dinner. The Coffee they served was above average and you could tip them just for their coffee and tea making.
They took card payment and remained friendly with us.
Location is cool, so its a good bet if you do not wanna show off yourself with 3/4/5 star hotels.

There were no Swimming pool or any such luxury stuff in hotel.

Also, do not book this hotel from net, got and bargain over counter. This way you get room you want at price you want.

Cheers,
Ravi","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r152530735-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"450","31731155","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e4/2d/d3/itsravie.jpg","255","37","153","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsravie","itsravie","4B110CE56FD9AAC3861446C82F4CDCE8",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","itsravie",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"

"Not recommended!","2","2011-11","2012-10-07","We stayed at this hotel last year because it read well on the internet. However our experience there was constantly disappointing. Here are some of the notes I made but didn't post on the internet at the time:
We arrived during a rain storm and the two bellboys who were standing at the door watching our arrival made no attempt to assist us with our baggage up the access stairs in case they got wet. The room was run down and musty (even the mattress) and there were large mouldy damp areas on the dirty carpeted floor. We requested a fan but it never came. We wanted to open the windows to clear the musty odour in the room but were advised to keep the windows closed to stop the aggressive local monkeys entering the room. The provided towels were holey and torn at the edges and mini sized. The location is right on the ,main road so it was very noisy from bus, car and truck engines and constantly tootling horns. Reception staff were running on flat batteries and didn't ever seem like they wanted to assist with anything. A few smiles from all the staff would have been nice but rarely encountered. I've stayed in some run down places during my travels but this hotel would rate as one of the worst.... not at all as it appeared on the internet and for the price it was lousy. The only saving grace was that it was only for three nights.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r142250434-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452387345","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg","1200","6","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinK901","Kevin K","6EDED5AACBBD17A949BE335321818000",,"255066","Darwin, Australia","Darwin","KevinK901",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"

I strongly feel that such fellow travellers are misguiding other travellers because of their personal problems. I must say that my last stay from 14th to 17th August 2012 was superb. I found it to be a very decent place for the money that you spend! The hotel is very conveniently located on the Circular road which is very close to Railway Station, ISBT and the happening Mall Road. The rooms are spacious, well furnished and clean, the food was good and the staff was just so helpful with everything.

"Very bad experience","1","2012-08","2012-08-16","We booked this hotel for 3 days but had to leave in just 1 day. Reasons:
1. No hot water
2. Toilets are not clean
3. Sometimes no water in flush
4. Most importantly drinking water was not clean at all.

Also the hotel boasts of being just 100m away from Mall road, but that way is very dangerous and you can not take this way in rainy seasons and also in nights. By car it was around 10 mins drive from mall road. 

Also BEWARE of Kanwar tours and Travels just next to the hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144813-r137336786-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","4","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaurav24g","gaurav24g","0632757F7FF605F692DD0F886FAAD6C0",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","gaurav24g",,,,,,,,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road Near Victory Tunnel, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Victory Hotel Circular Road, The Mall Road","Near Victory Tunnel","1144813","31.104973","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.16426","Hotel Victory","138","3.3","38","9","22","17","52","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144813-Reviews-Hotel_Victory-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.hotelvictory.in/"

Pros:-
1. Very near to the mall road.
2. Awesome roof top dining area ( best part )
3. Nice staff and very helping
4. Perfect for family stay

Cons:-
1. Parking is a big issue ( you have to manage it at your own ) and have to pay for that as well.
2. Room furnishing can be more better. You will not feel in 3 star kind of property.

"Not as described.","2","2016-11","2016-11-28","We felt that we had paid quite a lot for what we got....a quite small quite grubby room with nowhere to put our belongings. The hotel is reasonably central in Shimla, and the inclusive breakfast was not great but was generous. The staff were good at getting us something we could eat, an made us hot milk for our cornflakes!
However:
   We booked the place as it advertises free parking, a major issue in Shimla. But their free parking is simply a small drop off area at the front of the hotel where 12 cars can squeeze in close to one another( every car is jammed in, so you need to leave your car keys with the reception ) We were lucky to get squeezed in, but there is no guarantee of a place
  There is a strong WiFi signal, but it is so insecure that our email and internet systems would not let us use their signal. Effectively there is no WiFi.
   The hotel advertises a 24 hour reception facility. This is true at the main door at ground level. But there is another entry at the 10th floor, to the street above .  This entry has no staff cover and anyone can come in . It is not secure.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r440579628-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452386535","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","1200","19","93","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roslinlea","roslinlea","497D6F160CB88B28A5CFFE9459BDD6D7",,"186525","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Edinburgh","roslinlea",,"Manager","473066353","en","2017-04-05","","Dear Sir/Mamm,
Thanks for your valuable feedback. We have room categories ranging from Deluxe to Family suites therefore a Deluxe room would definitely be smaller in size than the other rooms. Thanks for appreciating our central location and our Buffet breakfast served in our roof top restaurant. Also Parking yes is definitely a big issue in Shimla but we have a limited parking space for 12-15 cars but apart from that we do provide parking for all our guests in nearby paid parking at our own costs. WIFI issues have been resolved and it now works quite efficiently. There are just a very few Hotels in Shimla providing access to the Mall Road from the backside of the Hotel. It is manned by a security staff and is on rounds through the clock .

"Just okay...","3","2016-10","2016-10-16","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The rooms are expensive for its standards but anyway Shimla is an expensive city. The room we got was on the top most floor and the view we got from the corridor was good. Breakfast buffet was very average. Rooms were old and walls were unpainted. The most important thing when I travel is the washroom and luckily it was renovated :P Another good thing is the location. Very close to the Mall and trust me this saves a lot of money since there are no local taxis in Shimla. Overall an average hotel to hop-in if you can adjust.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r428608618-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452388198","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deepannitad","Deepannita D","F5F2B37E8A1857CCBE1F34CAD09312FD",,,,,"deepannitad",,"Manager","473066580","en","2017-04-05","","Dear Sir/ Mamm,

Hotel staff were very much courteous all through our stay; they even helped us with our sightseeing programmes. The restaurant was nicely done & the food was delicious.

"Best budget hotel near The Mall Road","4","2016-08","2016-08-31","Hotel Surya is conveniently located and has access to the Mall road via a short flight of stairs.
We booked through goibibo and got a meaty deal with a price much lesser than the average room price. We stayed for a day and found the room equipped with modern amenities. The furnishings and bathroom fittings are luxurious and above average for a budget hotel.

The hotel has high hygiene standards and a hospitable staff. Though we did not order food from their restaurant but the meals are reasonably priced. Our package included a breakfast buffet which was decent and had a lot to offer in terms of variety. There was something for everyone- youth, aged parents and kids!
Parking facility is decent but not sure how they would manage on a busy weekend- they have space for about 8 to 10 cars only.

One major drawback is there is absolutely no view from the rooms- all you can see is the residential quarters of the staff. Also, the premises seem to have permanent residents in stray monkeys- you cant leave the window open at any cost.
A nice budget stay close to the Mall if you are here for a short stay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r413375970-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","211974083","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/a2/77/c3/umang-n.jpg","50","3","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/umangn1989","Umang N","0EF61301C430E12914F4E8C68DAF1CEB",,"297596","Chandigarh, India","Chandigarh","umangn1989",,"Manager","473088752","en","2017-04-06","","Dear Sir/ Mamm,

"Worth the price i paid for: read on..","5","2016-08","2016-08-19","This is my 100th review on TripAdvisor and a very rare 5-star one. 
The main reason is the price I paid. My trips usually happen at the last minute. I booked the hotel via GoIbibo at 6am and left Delhi at 6:30. Will not disclose the amount but lemme tell you it was a bargain due to last minute deals. 
Location is 500 mtrs from victory tunnel. Parking is ample for 6-8 cars but the road is usually packed during commute hours which means it can be a hassle to drive in or drive out. Staff is courteous and check in was smooth. Lifts are narrow but that is common in hills. My room no was 151 and I think it was in the renovated block. Was pleasantly surprised to see the room. Ample space. Sofa. Clean stuff including washroom. View wasn't the best but still could see the hills. Mall road is a five min walk away. 
Had breakfast. Restaurant view is breathtaking when it rains. Buffet spread was nice and food tasty. Loved the cheese sandwich and bhurji. Chai was good too.
Overall, my stay was brilliant. As I said, I m judging purely by the price I paid. Had I been a walk in customer, would have paid around 1500-2000 in off season and 2500-3000 in season.

The rooms were clean and efficient but the window view is of garbage and huts. There's a school next door, so mornings and afternoons were very noisy and If you are really unfortunate like us and land there on a saturday then you will be greeted with parade march on drumbeats for one hour. Not at all a relaxing place.

No coffee maker in room which is a standard across all hotels at this price point. Our hotel in Chail (Chail residency) at half the price had this, so not sure why surya cant provide this facility.

Upon telling the reception about the room location. He just shrugged his shoulders.

"Good option in Shimla","4","2016-04","2016-04-24","We stayed in hotel from 19-23 April 2016 ... We reached early morning and check in process was quick .. we were given upgrade to honeymoon suit .. the room was good with good view .  Staff was very helpful . 

The only thing they need to improve is the breakfast menu.. they need to add in more variety and options for foodies it will be a disappointment .   They need to add fruits and few more non veg variety to it .. also need to change the items on daily basis .. 

also need to improve wi -fi connectivity as i had to use my mobile net for all the 4 days ..

other then that its a good option in shimla .. ridge is just 10-15 mn walk from hotel ..","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r366886749-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452389859","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","1200","13","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/225anshul","Anshu L","C2935DF87B4F433179CF748011EC426F",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","225anshul",,"Public Relations Manager","606960173","en","2018-08-16","","Dear Sir/ Madam, Thanks for your valuable feedback.

"looks are not everything","3","2015-11","2016-03-25","Had a back room it was quiet but there are no doors to the outside leading to the market so anyone can walk in from the back of the hotel, as you can see from the damage to the bedroom door. The hotel in November was SO cold in the dining room.... again no doors so everyone sat with coats on and some even hoods up, no heating in there either, they take a lot of coach and school parties. You can see the mountains from the dining room, did not find any lounge area.If bedroom on top floor lift only goes half way up and you have to walk up the stairs. Staff were pleasant and did try, but bed and breakfast not really worth the money, breakfast toast and jam sandwich/very occasionally a egg, no fruit, but did have Indian meat meal if you fancied it. Evening meal same menu each day. On my last day 20/11/2015 they did issue electric fires for the bedroom, shower and toilet good. Plus side... it was very near to market street and town but if you are infirm, it is difficult as many steep steps to get there. If hotel not been paid for I would have moved out, expensive for what you got. Taxi's outside for trips, hotel ones safer as they know guides, but more expensive. 3 days long enough to stay in Shimla, unless you want to make longer journey's from there. Clarks Hotel  worth a visit, very up market and expensive to stay but nice to have a cup of tea and  a very reasonable price, cheaper than some places. Lots of monkey's  everywhere. Enjoyed the toy train to get there, fantastic views, and it stops for comfort stops and to get food and drinks, takes approx 5 hrs. on a hard seat.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r358365691-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","8","41","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosyface","rosyface","C0254F1B7DA59907912FB088F7D8706A",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","rosyface",,"Public Relations Manager","606961687","en","2018-08-16","","Dear Sir/ Madam, Thanks for your valuable feedback.We are sorry for any inconvenience if faced during stay.We would like to welcome you again whenever you visit Shimla.

"Nice place to stay in Shimla, but better option are still available","3","2015-05","2016-02-19","Hotel Surya is nice place to stay, rooms are quite average. Especially bedding/ interiors of rooms are average. Food quality is ""ok"". Room service/Hotel service is quite good and definitely this is one thing I liked here.
This hotel is located in the city and Mall road is so close that we can go there by hotel lift itself. 
Another good thing about this hotel is it's dining area! Open glass panel gives good view of beauty of Shimla valleys and in morning time sun rays will definitely make your day memorable. 

Lastly I would like to add, rooms are not having proper heating systems. We were there in May month so I did not face any problems as such but there was bit rain and drop in temperature where I felt this should be a problem in winters.

No specific room numbers as suggestion as there is pretty nothing which can be scenic visible from rooms.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r349178399-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452387885","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","1200","4","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chaitanya0106","Chaitanya0106","1E378F0AE1801F3342AE001A1A3D0ECF",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","Chaitanya0106",,"Public Relations Manager","606962923","en","2018-08-16","","Dear Sir/ Madam, Thanks for your valuable feedback.

We enjoyed two days  stay and were more comfortable in Hotel Victory as compared to the hotel which we had stayed earlier at the time of arrival in Shimla. The only problem was parking of the car which we had hired as they had limed parking in the hotel. There was government parking near the hotel where our driver parked the car.

"Bitterly cold","2","2015-12","2016-01-09","We stayed 1 night. Our room was a bit outdated but not too bad - however, the room was single glazed, poorly insulated, and heated only by a puny plug in 800w heater. Even with the extra blankets provided we slept wearing wool hats - you could see your breath in the air inside the room as it was between -6 and +2 degrees outside. It is really unacceptable in this day and age for a hotel bookable through global websites like Expedia that is located 7000 feet up in the mountains to be so poorly heated.

"Interesting stay for 2 days but could have been better","3","2015-11","2015-11-21","We booked this hotel online. Visited in Nov 2015. Baljees Residency is neighbour to it, Interesting hotel. Has 2 wings if i may elaborate. A front buliding with 8 floors topped by a roof top restaurant, and a 4 storied building above it in the back which has a passage leading to the upper mall road. The rooms have been renovated i guess. I believe they allot the back building for those booked online, Front rooms are for the ones walking in. So check on it. We got the back building but we did not grumble as the rooms had good views. 

The back door leads to a passage which leads to a steep staircase that leads to the mall road. The Shimla kalibari is in walking distance from it uphill. Breakfast had limited choice but was ok. Service was good. Food was good too. We had dinner on both days. Very good terrace restaurant with wonderful view. Lock your windows as monkeys are frequent visitors here and there. Wifi was more or less ok but who but that was not so much significant to us. Our room also had a ceiling mirror which was odd.

Car parking available, has an SBI ATM opposite to the main entrance. For people being allotted the back building you need to go up to the 8th floor to the terrace restaurant and then take the alleyway for another lift or staircase to the building. We found it quite interesting. Overall, nice experience. But if you book online check out if being given fresh rooms in the front building.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d546044-r328172587-Hotel_Surya-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"682","113968355","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/cb/04/e3/arinov1976.jpg","682","25","155","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arinov1976","arinov1976","024FF4B6ED2B354CC791C14F27A1D784",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","arinov1976",,"Manager","329304541","en","2015-11-26",,"Thanks for your feedback.
