"Demand for additional payment for early check in, the amount mentioned was half of the room price for a day.","3","2024-07","2024-07-17","Me and my husband reserved the stay for a day and called the hotel reception two days in advance to let us early checkin. Since we were running on tight schedule, early checkin at 07:30am was important and unavoidable. There was no mention of additional charges for the early checkin during our enquiry. On the day of checkin the lady at the reception demanded half the room price as early checkin charges. After I told her about my previous enquiries, she asked me to show the proof of my enquiry, I had to show her the call logs which I was not happy as this is personal. Coming from long overnight journey with prereserved and pre enquired request, I did not expect this behaviour during our checkin. At the end she did not charge extra but what if I had not shown her my call logs as proof? And what if the guests are under personal pressure or trauma during the visit. What if I had no additional amount?

The breakfast buffet, included in room charge, is wonderful and includes non-vegetarian items such as made to order omelettes. The customer service is particularly impressive.

"Hotel not safe!!!","1","2023-12","2024-01-21","This hotel is UNSAFE!!
Pre-paid & booked this hotel room for family events from Dec 3 to Dec 23. 
Due to centrally located location, we decided to book this hotel. After we arrived on Dec 3 around 3am, our room was not available but were given a standard room until noon time. Then we have to travel to another state for few days leaving all our luggage and personal belongings in the room. The manager & other hotel staff entered our room and moved our belongings without our consent & may be to rent it out to while we are out & may be pocket the revenue. During this illegal activities, they removed my wife's insulin pens from the refrigerator and left in one our bags and thus destroying the pens after we found out when we arrived back in the hotel. The staff went through our entire personal belongings in the closet. Nothing was stolen other than insulin pens were destroyed and dumping all our personal belongings in plastic bags.
I immediately called the front office manager, Md. Nasim and informed about the incident. The manager never provided explanation as to why and who went through our stuff while were out. Definitely looks like the manager is also involved in this illegal activities.
I even emailed to the hotel management and didn't even get a single response.

"A good option for a short stay","4","2024-01","2024-01-07","We were in town to attend a wedding and needed accommodation for 2 nights close to the venue. The President Hotel fit our needs quite well. The room is compact/cosy (basically small but not in a bad way) and it could be cramped for longer stays but for 2 nights, it was not a problem. 
The room was clean, the beds were comfortable. The breakfast buffet has a large variety of fresh food that is mostly good - stick to the popular local favorites and you won't go wrong. 
They were renovating the 1st floor while we were there so noise was a slight problem during the day but they accommodated our request and gave us a room on a higher floor a little away from the noise. It didn't help much but I did appreciate that they tried. 
The staff are what makes this hotel a delight. Very friendly, polite, helpful. I asked for help in tying my saree for the event and Maya a very sweet girl was really helpful.  
This hotel is a good option for mid-budget travelers.

From the moment I stepped in, I was impressed by the immaculate cleanliness of the hotel. The management prioritizes a well-maintained and hygienic environment. I stayed in an executive room for two days, which was not only spacious but also elegantly decorated, providing a luxurious feel.

The on-site restaurant was a delightful surprise. Especially if you like Andhra-style food then you will not be disappointed. The included breakfast offered a wide variety of choices, catering to different tastes and preferences. We were so impressed with the quality of the food that we decided to have our dinners there as well.
The President Hotel stands out as an ideal family-friendly hotel.

"Great overall stay","4","2023-10","2023-11-08","I stayed at the hotel with a family member for a week and we enjoyed our stay.  The food in both restaurants was tasty and well cooked, the breakfast was good too.  The rooms were clean and when there was an issue with the A/C it was resolved quickly.  Overall I have no problems with the hotel itself and would happily stay there again.  The one frustrating drawback was with the airport pick up that was arranged via the hotel.  The standard expectation is that the pick up would meet us in arrivals, with our names on a board to identify they were expecting us.  However, they weren’t there and we were told they were waiting for us at the airport, but we weren’t told where.  We only found our driver with the help of someone else there to pick up a different traveller.

"Good business hotel ","5","2023-09","2023-10-08","Went for a business trip. The stay was suggested by my colleague at bangalore. It's been nice hotel to me. I got a suite room for 2 nights. Rooms are well maintained and with all amenities. Restaurant also had yummy foods. Andhra ruchulu is one of the famous in bangalore for Andhra cuisine. Quality and quantity all was awesome. 
I has great sound sleep as rooms were sound proof. Dinner were served in room and it was tasty. 
I had to check out early morning around 5:30am, I couldn't get any breakfast packed for myself and this was not informed to me while I updated previous night at the reception about my early check out. 
Overall it's been nice stay will be one of the place I will sure stay whenever I visit bangalore. It was also very near to my office.

"Modest accommodation","3","2019-09","2019-09-13","The property is located on Resthouse road (2nd right from Brigade Road, as you enter from MG Road). The Resthouse Road is one-way, cannot enter from Brigade Road, so had to get down from the cab on Brigade Road and walk down the short 50 odd meters.
This was a very short business stay, just one night. The room was clean with all basic amenities, the mattress on the bed was uncomfortable and needed a replacement. Room service was prompt, with friendly staff. The food tasted average though. Had to leave early in the morning the next day, didn't get an opportunity to have breakfast, but I guess it is served in the room, no buffet.
Overall, a modest accommodation at a modest price, at a great location.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d4045454-r709334624-Olive_Rest_House_Road_by_Embassy_Group-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"252","300566793","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/ea/49/09/shantanu-s76.jpg","252","33","872","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shantanu_s76","Shantanu","CB17951E1B60F1DDD44A4939CA2A4674",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","Shantanu_s76",,,,,,,,"6, Rest House Rd Shanthala Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Bengaluru 560001 India","Bengaluru","India","560001","Karnataka","6, Rest House Rd","Shanthala Nagar, Ashok Nagar","4045454","12.9737","Bengaluru, Bangalore District, Karnataka","77.60676","Olive Rest House Road by Embassy Group","136","3.4","18","18","28","33","39","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297628-d4045454-Reviews-Olive_Rest_House_Road_by_Embassy_Group-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.oliveliving.com"

"Hotel that cannot guarantee basics","2","2019-07","2019-07-15","I stayed for two nights and both mornings had to call up reception several times to get hot water. Without hot water a hotel has no business to be open in Bangalore and this was a mid-range hotel.

On last morning I called them to wake up and switch on their centralised geyser(Yes, that's the excuse they gave for there not being hot water previous day; that a staff 'accidentally' switched it off) and told them I have to checkout in 30 mins to cath a flight. I didn't get hot water within that time and so I simply got ready and came to reception to checkout. Only to find they all blissfully sleeping and door is locked. At 0530 AM, in a hotel, even after I called them. It took another 5 mins to wake them up, find keys etc and after I yelled they let me checkout without them finishing the room checkup. Horrible service.

And everything was dirty or broken. Torn and dirty towels, dirty bathroom, dirty toilet paper, broken fixtures. I didn't take pics on first day thinking it is an anomaly. Apparently not. They replaced tissue with another which was only less dirty. Rest in pics.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d4045454-r689818124-Olive_Rest_House_Road_by_Embassy_Group-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,,,,,"0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akilan27","AKI","7B1F6F246463C647D0D9E917425F92C2",,,,,"akilan27",,,,,,,,"6, Rest House Rd Shanthala Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Bengaluru 560001 India","Bengaluru","India","560001","Karnataka","6, Rest House Rd","Shanthala Nagar, Ashok Nagar","4045454","12.9737","Bengaluru, Bangalore District, Karnataka","77.60676","Olive Rest House Road by Embassy Group","136","3.4","18","18","28","33","39","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297628-d4045454-Reviews-Olive_Rest_House_Road_by_Embassy_Group-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.oliveliving.com"

"An Okay review for an Okay Place","3","2018-05","2018-05-25","The hotel staff was awake to recieve me late night, however the hotel is hard to find as the road had no street lights on. The signage is not sufficently lit, and hence finding it was difficult. However, the 'Upgrade' to a suite was not really a suite. It was just a larger room. The rooms were tidy, but had visible marks for wear and tear. The AC was just okay to cool, and the controls didnt seem to work.  

No choice during breakfast was not a good thing, and I ended up eating dry parathas and a bowl of fruits was welcomed.

This is a good place, if youre just passing by (like I was). I would not reccomend the same. But if you have it, it's just about okay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d4045454-r582591075-Olive_Rest_House_Road_by_Embassy_Group-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","2","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlvitoFalcon","AlvitoFalcon","EDC50AD2E46FA1ADF7E95901C9D033DE",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","AlvitoFalcon",,"Guest Relations Manager","585227709","en","2018-06-04","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

The rooms are ok, but the maintenance and service is poor. The tap in the bathroom sink was rickety and leaking water. even on repeated compliant nothing was done. There was no hot water in the evenings. The bed linen was old, pale and yellow, covered with stains and torn. The towels were rough, pale and tattered at the edges. The bead headrest was dirty and smelled, with stuffing coming out at places.

The room had not being properly cleaned with hairs of previous occupants scattered all around. The bedside lamp was broken and took 2 days to repair. The air-con and had poor cooling.

Breakfast was really bad with 4 cold idli's (rice cakes) served on an open plate. No choice of breakfast and the breakfast served is a sham. 

Reception was sleepy at best and poor customer orientation. There was this gentleman there who was mostly watching movies on his cell phone. I arrived late in the night and the hotel entry was locked and took me quiet a while to get them to open the door. The staff had locked the hotel and was sleeping on the reception floor.

The housekeeping staff and supervisors could be heard fighting on the floor. 

In all a poor experience.

"Review On one night stay at the hotel","3","2017-12","2017-12-31","When giving the address do let the Cab driver its Off Brigade road ,also mention Resthouse Road.Since its a one way lane , you might face navigation issue.
If you are travelling with Family , its better to have a call to the Hotel and ask the Driver of the Cab to get the information.

Staff (Jeet) is very good as to receive the Customer even if he is into the Food Department of the restaurant.

I had booked two rooms, one at the first floor was very good and modern.
The other room at the  second floor was very old.

Room service was nice.

1 liter water bottle was given as complementary but if you need more then you need to pay for it.

Need improvement:
1.For break fast, we need to tell Jeet , as to how many plates of the available dishes we need ,as every day they have different bundle of food available. 
2.For Hot water we are asked to through 1 balti water
3.Rooms shown in the Treebo site and actual are different in terms of Size and cleanlyness

The Owner of the Hotel is a very nice person ,you can certainly ask for the ways to places.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d4045454-r550539092-Olive_Rest_House_Road_by_Embassy_Group-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","2","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atishsupakar","AtishSupakar","0F81FCF3F6EA408CC842986DFDBFAF20",,"297586","Hyderabad, India","Hyderabad","atishsupakar",,"Guest Relations Manager","551445924","en","2018-01-04","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest, Thank you so much for choosing to stay with us and sharing your valuable feedback.

"Appearance","3","2017-12","2017-12-27","The hotel was looking more of lodge than a hotel. While booking the room rate was including breakfast. We expected it as buffet but actual it was order where we have to do it previous night. From the time we checked-in till check-out the Reception staff was the same person. We saw the F&B staff cleaning the room also. There are certain which I would like to point out.
When I called reception and asked for 2 bath towels and the response was not prompt enough because not only it was delivered to the room after waiting so long to have shower but only brought 1 instead of 2 nos. The menu was kept in the room where i ordered Beer and the Receptionist said they don't have it. My question if you don't have the following items which is printed in the menu card then why is kept in the room? Either you should update the Menu Card or remove it totally. Rest everything was fine the staff were polite and thank you so much for amending the check-in date as per my request. When i called the toll free no. the lady who answered the phone was very polite and hospitable.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d4045454-r549626576-Olive_Rest_House_Road_by_Embassy_Group-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skurien01","skurien01","6786C9FA5134E73FE437D97BFB2CDB53",,,,,"skurien01",,"Guest Relations Manager","551443035","en","2018-01-04","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest, Thank you so much for choosing to stay with us and sharing your valuable feedback.

"Terrible Experience – Unsafe for Families  I had an extremely unpleasant stay at Gulf Hotel Colaba","1","2024-10","2024-10-17","Terrible Experience – Unsafe for Families

I had an extremely unpleasant stay at Gulf Hotel Colaba, and I strongly advise against choosing this hotel, especially for families. The staff, particularly the manager Jabbir Alom, displayed shockingly rude behavior. He lacks basic courtesy and does not know how to speak respectfully, especially towards women and families.

The room conditions were appalling. The bedsheets were damp, and the overall hygiene was questionable. The rooms are much smaller than advertised in the pictures, giving a misleading impression. Worse still, the atmosphere of the hotel is completely inappropriate for families. Illegal activities seem to be rampant here, and there’s constant hookah smoke lingering in the air. The hotel is often filled with men smoking hookah, making it feel unsafe and uncomfortable.

It’s also evident that the staff, backed by local political connections, behave like they are above the law. They act with arrogance, knowing that the police will turn a blind eye to complaints. The staff's behavior is unprofessional and intimidating, more like that of local goons than hospitality workers.

Choosing this hotel was by far the worst decision of my life. It’s not a safe or clean environment, and I would urge anyone considering a stay here to look elsewhere.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d1141615-r974248573-Gulf_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/772yasirg","Yasir G","09A9F941CD8D0D580E024901E068779B",,,,,"772yasirg",,,,,,,,"HNA Azmi Marg Road 3rd Floor Kamal Mansion, Mumbai 400005 India","Mumbai","India","400005","Maharashtra","HNA Azmi Marg Road","3rd Floor Kamal Mansion","1141615","18.91841","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.83088","Gulf Hotel","108","3.9","15","8","12","9","64","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d1141615-Reviews-Gulf_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","https://gulfhotelmumbai.com/"
"Average Hotel in a great location!!","3","2024-04","2024-04-13","I along with my parents stayed at Gulf Hotel, Colaba for one night in a triple bed room. Chose this hotel given its location and so called good reviews. The hotel is located in an old building like most budget/midrange hotels of South Mumbai. It essentially starts from the 4th floor which is accessed by a tiny lift (max 2 full grown adults capacity excluding lift man). The check in was smooth and staff starting from the ever smiling liftman to the receptionist are courteous. However, the rooms are small, poorly lit and claustrophobic. Bathroom which is even smaller stinks. Only 1 bottle (250ml) drinking water per person is provided. Room service is lazy and quality of food is average. Food orders take ages to get delivered. Dinner consisting of simple dal chawal, egg curry, etc ordered at 9.45 pm was delivered at 11.30 pm and that too after repeated reminders. The only reason to stay in this hotel is it's location being close to the Gateway of India and Taj Hotel. The neighborhood has a touristy vibe and evenings are pleasant. 
In short, I would stop just short of recommending this place. I would suggest a bit more research and adding a few extra bucks per night to book a better place in the immediate vicinity.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d1141615-r946508861-Gulf_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,,,,,"11","60","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FBghy","Fatiul Biraj","89E207B8CE5221C56AC45AD70EEB74F8",,"503692","Guwahati, India","Guwahati","FBghy",,,,,,,,"HNA Azmi Marg Road 3rd Floor Kamal Mansion, Mumbai 400005 India","Mumbai","India","400005","Maharashtra","HNA Azmi Marg Road","3rd Floor Kamal Mansion","1141615","18.91841","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.83088","Gulf Hotel","108","3.9","15","8","12","9","64","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d1141615-Reviews-Gulf_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","https://gulfhotelmumbai.com/"
"A fairly good hotel","3","2024-02","2024-02-26","Pros: I think the best aspect of this hotel is its location. It is very close to Gate of India and the strand by the sea along which you can take an early morning walk or an evening walk. A good choice of halal restaurants are just within walking distance. The staff is friendly and helpful.     

Cons: I booked a three-people executive room which I expected to be more spacious. Overall, the hotel gives you a cramped feeling. The elevator contributes to that feeling the most as two people can barely fit in it (excluding the lift man!). I felt the room rent to be higher than usual, perhaps because Mumbai is an expensive city. The worst aspect is the hotel's wifi connection. I had to be at a particular corner of my room to get my devices connected to the internet and use them. Lastly, if you are a frequent mall-goer, you may feel a bit disappointed because the big malls of Mumbai aren't located in this part of the city.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d1141615-r939856499-Gulf_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452389009","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coastal51212538079","Asad","44B5E25344D98AA752263FEE3D5C5DB9",,"293936","Dhaka City, Bangladesh","Dhaka City","Coastal51212538079",,,,,,,,"HNA Azmi Marg Road 3rd Floor Kamal Mansion, Mumbai 400005 India","Mumbai","India","400005","Maharashtra","HNA Azmi Marg Road","3rd Floor Kamal Mansion","1141615","18.91841","Mumbai, Maharashtra","72.83088","Gulf Hotel","108","3.9","15","8","12","9","64","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d1141615-Reviews-Gulf_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html","https://gulfhotelmumbai.com/"

"Good for individuals or couples; not as family friendly with young children as advertised","4","2022-07","2022-07-25","The hotel is clean, service is fantastic, and continental breakfast was amazing.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite: mini fridge, sink, desk, TV, and 2 chairs in the common area; bed, TV, closet, and bathroom in the bedroom. Space is good for a couple or family with 1 child. We had 2 young children and it felt a little cramped for us. We booked a room with a king bed; the reality was a full bed. We asked if there was a room with a larger bed and were told this was the largest bed they had in the hotel. The bed was very comfortable to sleep on and big enough for me and our 2 young kids. We had to request a rollaway bed for my husband, which was an additional 800 rupees ($10 USD) per night. Water pressure in the shower was good, however, the door didn't close all the way and some water would escape into the bathroom. A/C was a very welcome greeting after being out during the day. The only downside was that we would get wafts of cigarette smoke, exhaust, and food smells from the restaurant.

Overall, we had a good stay and I would stay again, making sure to book additional or adjoining rooms for our family of 4.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d677989-r849790677-The_President_Hotel-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"683","129463743","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/b7/75/bf/ehagarty.jpg","683","18","75","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evasishtah","Erin V","E1F8BD8D9F30C9ABA87EFC1BE623E09E",,"58702","Redmond, Washington","Redmond","evasishtah",,"General Manager","850114530","en","2022-07-27","Thilak S","Dear Erin Vasishtah , Thank you so much for taking the time to write this thorough and insightful review.

"Not value for money","2","2021-09","2021-09-14","Except for the location -- which is the reason I chose this hotel -- the hotel has nothing to speak for it.  The room is cramped, food is about ok,  and most importantly, the air-conditioning wasn't working and wasn't fixed despite bringing it to the hotel's notice. All this would have been tolerable if the front desk wasn't so nonchalant about the issues. The desk was superficially polite but you can sense that they don't give a damn, except mouthing routine apologies. On top of it, they play good-cop bad-cop to pacify angry customers. A guest was furiously complaining about a/c when I was checking in, and I thought the problem was specific to their room. How innocent I was. On the positive side, the non-front-desk staff did seem genuinely courteous, and there's a restaurant that's popular with locals on weekends.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d677989-r809948713-The_President_Hotel-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452390706","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quest612947","YesJee","ABE19DA61710BBB55EC27D8EAE8C758B",,"297586","Hyderabad, India","Hyderabad","Quest612947",,"General Manager","812833536","en","2021-10-03","Thilak S","Dear Yesjee , We are extremely concerned of your dissatisfaction and low rating.

"Horrible experience!!","1","2020-09","2020-09-07","I stayed at the President Hotel in Bangalore for 3 nights. This was the worst hotel experience I've ever had.

1. Upon arrival, we were given a room that had 2 single beds, even though we requested one queen/king size bed.
2. They gave us another room, whose flush was broken and wouldn't work at all.
3. We were given another room, which was okay initially.
4. At night the hotel guys switched off the AC, it was so so hot. We had to fight to get it working again the next night.
5. One of the room service guy was so rude and disrespectful. He would answer back and rudely say no to anything we asked (extra bottle, extra spoons)
6. The bathroom started stinking of the drain after a few hours, despite asking the hotel help to clean and do something about it.

All in all this is not a recommended hotel to stay at all for the price it demands!

Not worth the money at all, I can't rate it less than 1 unfortunately. I wouldn't stay here for free!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d677989-r769202946-The_President_Hotel-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandeeprds95","Sandeep R","EFBABB39FAD912547D00434BE830F673",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","sandeeprds95",,"General Manager","783368848","en","2021-02-22","Thilak S","Dear Sandeeprds95, thank you for visiting  The President Hotel Bangalore !!!!

"Not welcoming","3","2025-04","2025-10-16","Hotel room was fine, clean and modern.
Breakfast range was huge and very nice variety and tasty, buffet dinner was okay, average .

Check in took a while, they offer treats and goodies (golden ticket/toys) to some people but not everyone which made the kids feel excluded. Strange as everywhere else in India- they seem to adore kids.

I guess the let down is the staff at the front desk, they don’t engage in conversation or banter nor are welcoming or able to provide info without many prompts… they were quite robotic.
The staff who manage the security and luggage are more engaging and seem happy to see you.

It is our earnest endeavor to maintain at all times a courteous, warm, pleasant & inclusive atmosphere. However, I regret that our processes failed you. I have addressed the same with the concerned teams with the seriousness that it deserves. 

I am still keen on connecting with you to understand your feedback in detail as the dates of stay are featuring for the month of April,25. May I request you to please share a convenient, date, time and an active mobile number to connect.

"Average hotel, but good location, good for short stay.","4","2017-07","2017-07-12","I booked a Standard OAK room during July 2017
Pros
1. Nice location, Brigade road and MG Road are the most happening places.
2. Commercial street and all shopping locations nearby, theatre too.
3. Hotel staff very cooperative, straight forward. Manager was good.
4. The wall portraits were good outside the room, in hallway stairs etc

Cons
1. Complimentary food No buffet, instead they give boxed idlis etc to the room.
2. Rooms are small, I have seen 3-4 rooms. Deluxe rooms are slightly bigger, still small as per my view.
3. Hot water never came during my stay of 2 days 1 night. There could be some problem. They say they have switched on the boiler, even I waited 20 mins and flushed all the cold water i could, but no use. Finally bathe in cold water only.
4. The room lights were flickering which was corrected after complaint. I saw flickering lights in 3 places.
5. For 3rd person accommodation they give only mattress and put it on room floor. The mattress was very hard and no space tom move around after putting it. Not able to open restroom door also.
6. I asked for room migration to deluxe but they could not do it since all rooms are full.
7. The guest room in basement floor had broken full size mirror.
8. TV was very small.
9. No lifts, some construction going on.
10. Wifi was not working in First Floor. i stayed in 107. Its working in 2nd floor and ground floor. it says wifi password invalid. but receptionist says that password is only correct. some problem he dont know. He suggested to sit in reception sofa and browse :(
11. Some building work still goes on on 2nd floor it seems, not neat and clean. Truly not TREEBO experience.
12. The way outside rooms are flooded with cigarette smell. Even the bathrooms are little smelly, but they said they will apply room spray and asked us to keep the bathroom door open for 10-15 mins.
13. At 10 o clock itself they started calling me asking me to check out in 1 hr. I felt bad about that, A gentle reminder should be enough instead of severe push for check out. I checked out around 11:10, the guy was not even ready to entertain 11:30, he said guests are waiting, when went downstairs I could see no one.

My wife and cousin and felt very bad about this hotel, certainly not TREEBO need lots of improvement. I feel like OK type for a budget hotel.

I paid 1856 for 3 ppl and one night stay. TREEBO gave 400 rs off. So nice bet for Brigade Road stay,

I feel this hotel is OK but need improvement, may be in few months they will get stabilized.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d4045454-r501292192-Olive_Rest_House_Road_by_Embassy_Group-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","0","26","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuriyakumarJ","Suriyakumar J","96CE5A26F4B4D3253CFD5225ED60A2F9",,,,,"SuriyakumarJ",,"Guest Relations Manager","501786855","en","2017-07-13","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Poor Maintenance and Service","2","2019-04","2019-04-12","I was staying in Room 1309. Room is fine. But the AC control is placed in the silliest manner on the ceiling. You need to get on a sofa to reach it. The toilet is terribly small. You can actually sit in the loo, while taking a bath. I politely requested for an upgrade. I was curtly told, they have very few rooms left and they can’t upgrade. I can see a lot of empty rooms. Though they are not obligated to upgrade, but it could have been great Cust Service. 
Since evening, no TV. I was told to watch the free channels. Took these guys 3.5 hrs to fix it. 
My first stay at this hotel. As I travel at least once a month to Bangalore and could have made this hotel my permanent destination. Doubt it, if I would now. 
Disappointed and totally disgusted, trying to fix the TV. Seems these guys haven’t paid their cable bills. 
The breakfast spread in the morning, was at the most - Average. 
The only good part about the hotel, was it’s FANTASTIC location. 
Disappointing stay overall.

"Don't let the rankings mislead you!","1","2017-03","2017-04-05","We as a group of four, stayed one night in this hotel. The location is great and you can have good access to everything around. The hotel is really avarage and doesn't look like the pictures! Its not that much clean so we didn't feel comfortable. But the main reason that I am writing this comment is our very bad experience for construction noise. It was not mentioned anywhere that the hotel is under construction and nobody mentioned when we checked in. After a long haul flight we decided to sleep a bit. It was 3 pm but very soon we realized the upper floor was under construction and the noise of hammer machine was terrible! The hotel manager told us it would finish at 5 pm but that was not true and it took till around 7 pm. We thought we could sleep at night but very surprisingly the construction started at 6 am! three or four times we asked the hotel staff to stop it or at least made it later. Each time they said OK but after just ten minutes the noise started again. I have traveled a lot and stayed in cheap or expensive hotels but never seen such disrespectful attitude. In one sentence I can say they don't care their clients and I dont recommend it at all.

"Budget accommodation - place to crash after a late night of partying","3","2017-02","2017-02-28","Location - 
Just off brigade road, at 5 minutes walking distance from Church street and MG road metro station. This is the only highlight of the hotel

Wifi & Air conditioning -
These two being the basic necessities in hotel selection these days, Morgen suites faired well on both points.
It had fair internet connectivity - in the lobby and in the room as well.
Good AC without much noise for a peaceful sleep

Services -
This place is strictly NO frills. Actually, we did not even have hot water during both the days of our stay. 

Breakfast -
Does not provide a buffet breakfast, although the hotel has a restaurant on the ground floor. It is expected to serve 2 options for breakfast meals, juice, coffee/tea (according to Treebo). All we got was 2 idlis each and a sachet of instant coffee.

If you are looking for a economy hotel to stay after a late night in Bangalore (Cruch street, MG road, Indiranagar), this is the place for you.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d4045454-r463613797-Olive_Rest_House_Road_by_Embassy_Group-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reachaatish","reachaatish","DCC4E8387B76C0F4DB697F3B239B3DBE",,"154913","Calgary, Canada","Calgary","reachaatish",,"Guest Relations Manager","464751459","en","2017-03-05","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

It is situated in the most prime location of Bangalore and every type of shopping store and all kinds of restaurants, malls are within 10 minutes of walking distance. Dominos and many pubs are just in front of the hotel only. the metro station is 2 minutes walking distance.
Rooms are very clean and you get a mini bar and a bathtub in the room. 
The price is very reasonable for the services and quality of room you get. 
Staffs are very helpful and friendly.
Room is awesome and so is the room service. You get free breakfast too and that one is good too!

"Dingy, dilapidated.","1","2018-08","2018-11-06","The hotel is showing it's age.

The ""comfort room"" was anything but comfortable. It's small and cramped. Everything has a sense of deterioration. The single window (which doesn't open) has a view of an open ventilation duct where the ventilation area itself is dirty and has exposed pipes and cables.
The control panel for the air conditioning is fixed on the ceiling in a corner (for Godsakes!). You can hardly notice it, let alone reach it. I had to call housekeeping every time I wanted to change the temperature setting! Absurd!
The door to the toilet directly opens on to the shower curtain! The toilet itself is so cramped, only a contortionist can move without brushing against the disgustingly moldy shower curtain each time. The metal in the toilet has rust. 

The staff are a mix of North-Eastern and Southern populace. The former are polite, friendly and helpful. Most of the latter have attitude and couldn't care less. This was expected as I've had to unfortunately visit the President hotel in Hubli many times where again, most of the staff are discourteous.

The breakfast spread is more than sufficient and is appetizing.

I stayed here because it was conveniently located for my work. I won't be repeating the mistake and would rather deal with the Bangalore traffic.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d677989-r631268555-The_President_Hotel-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg","1200","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikramV233","Vikram V","E70206DF107BC754AB41BE67CEA58D84",,"1154299","Hubli-Dharwad, India","Hubli-Dharwad","VikramV233",,"General Manager","631803608","en","2018-11-07","GMpaihotels","Dear Guest,

"Best in hospitality","5","2018-09","2018-09-06","Was in town for a business trip and President Hotel is where I was put up. The hospitality received by the staff of the hotel was remarkable and the food in their restaurants, Gufha and Andhra Ruchulu, have their unique secret ingredient in every dish they have to offer. It feels like homely food but with a twist. Apart from food ambience is something to notice. The Gufha (hindi word for a cave) is a themed restaurant with the ambiance designed in a way that one will feel that they are actually dining inside a cave. Over all the experience was great as I got to enjoy the place among business deals.
Would like to come back and have a longer experience with them.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d677989-r614493639-The_President_Hotel-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","145632944","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/ae/2e/b0/shweta-u.jpg","50","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shwetz510","Shwetz510","6824E403DB560053AEA5B14D306BF58B",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","Shwetz510",,"General Manager","614731055","en","2018-09-07","GMpaihotels","Dear Guest,

"Standards Have Dropped – Disappointing Stay for a Regular Guest","2","2025-09","2025-09-29","I have been a regular guest at JW Marriott for many years, but my most recent stay was disappointing compared to past visits.

Despite requesting a specific room and floor over 12 months ago, my request was not honoured. To make matters worse, I learned that the room on the floor I had requested was given to a guest who had booked more recently. This was frustrating and not the level of consideration I expect as a loyal customer.

The room I was allocated also had damp issues, which I reported to the front desk manager. Unfortunately, the overall service levels throughout the property felt much lower than in previous stays.

On a positive note, the staff at Lotus Café (breakfast service) and the Spa, particularly Pravin, continue to uphold the JW Marriott standards with attentive and professional service. They remain the highlight of the hotel experience.

I truly hope the management takes steps to restore the consistency and quality that once made this property a standout.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299754-r1032643766-JW_Marriott_Mumbai_Juhu-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452387402","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/216bhupendrat","Bhupendra T","552E8BAC2D835A992A4F335FBF04FDF1",,,,,"216bhupendrat",,"General Manager","1032898758","en","2025-09-30","Nikita Ramchandani","Dear Tripadvisor Member,

I would like to specifically mention Andres and Chinmay from front desk team for all their efforts and time. Very very attentive, supportive and extremely customer centric. 

Also what made our stay further more memorable was the lounge and entire staff there- Worring, Nachiket, Makan and Harsh. Truly the best of team, extremely empathetic and helpful.  We ended up spending most of our time in the lounge because of this reason- great hospitality and excellent services. 

Lastly, I would also like to add that our experience at Lotus cafe during their midnight hours was disappointing- from being served to cold soup to dirty plates to unbothered servers about the food feedback.

"AVOID this seedy hotel!!","1","2019-10","2019-11-21","We ended up having to stay at this hotel when there was a last minute issue with our airbnb - they arranged for us to stay here and if we had looked at the reviews first would have avoided it!

Service is shocking. Staff were incredibly unhelpful and not pleasant. Breakfast was included in our booking yet they insisted we pay for it. We asked them not to service our room as we did not feel comfortable with this. When we came home we found a window we had locked was wide open. When we asked the manager why someone had entered our room when we asked them not to he said ""the wind must have blown it open!!"". It was a heavy locked window. 

It was so unpleasant we left early and really hope others are warned not to stay here.

"Gulf Hotel in Colaba Mumbai","3","2018-12","2019-03-04","Das Gulf Hotel ist gerade neben dem Radio Club in Colaba Mumbai. Nicht zu verwechseln mit dem Hotel Gulf…..das 500 Meter weiter weg ist.Die Taxifahrer verwechseln es immer, daher einfach den Radio Club nennen somit kommt man am richtigen Hotel an. Der Eingang zum Hotel ist mit vielen arabischen Menschen umsammelt und rund ums Hotel befinden sich arabische Geschäfte. Die Touristen aus diesen ""saudi"" arabischen Ländern steigen gerne hier ab. Die Reception ist im 3 Stock (es hat einen Fahrstuhl mit Portier). Achtung einige Zimmer haben kein Fenster. Auch für ein Mittelklass Hotel ist zu bemängeln dass Warmwasser nicht immer vorhanden ist. Das Gebäude selber ist in einem etwas bedürftigen Zustand. wie auch die Zimmer. Zudem ist die Wäsche nicht über alle Zweifel erhaben. Die Zimmerboys bringen Ihnen was man bestellt, rund um die Ihr.

As a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite member, I regularly stay at Marriott hotels worldwide, and I’ve always appreciated the high standard of service. That’s why this experience came as a surprise and did not meet the level of hospitality I’ve come to expect.

"Exceptional Hospitality and Service","5","2025-08","2025-08-31","I have never stayed at a JW property and chose it based on proximity to the spaces I had to visit and work out of in Mumbai.  From the moment I checked in, it was apparent and it may have been a location of convenience but I would not regret it.  I have to give a special shout out to a front office executive, ANDREZ CRASTO. He was hospitable and helpful and clearly values customer loyalty as he went out of his way to help me sort out not just my room, but also ones for my team. Given the non-traditional working hours I keep, I usually ended up with room service - the food was excellent, and they were very accommodating of my allergies too.  I certainly look forward to another stay at the JW Juhu, when next in the country/ vicinity.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299754-r1027793719-JW_Marriott_Mumbai_Juhu-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","1","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsJNYC","D J","5A0CB41BBDE193E919200C8898A8CCFA",,"60763","New York City, New York","New York City","MsJNYC",,"General Manager","1028113047","en","2025-09-01","Nikita Ramchandani","Dear Tripadvisor Member,

"Worst customer service","1","2018-08","2018-08-21","The hotel lacks in customer service/centricity and keen only to grab money somehow or other.  I had booked for 3 nights and requested for early check-in, which they accepted.  While I checked in by 8.35 am, they had mentioned as 7.47 in their records and did not have any explanation for this wrong timing.  The check out is 12 noon and for a 2.5 hrs late check out (14.40), they charged half a day cost and were very impolite while I argued the rationale.  Moreover, they tried grabbing INR 3000, which is more than half a day cost and I had to fight to get the excess charge paid back.  The front office personnel have absolutely no clue of either customer service or mathematics (they could not figure out what is the half a day cost).  The stay experience was average and the breakfast was very ordinary.

The room service served hot boiling milk in a glass (like the local tea shops) and gave some lame excuse on why it cannot be brought in a flask.

Overall, a very ordinary stay and worst customer experience.  Would not stay there again nor would recommend ever to my friends.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d677989-r608777365-The_President_Hotel-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452386535","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632ramachandrans","Ramachandran S","97D27177DDD1B53658E5084FEAA6BAC0",,,,,"632ramachandrans",,"General Manager","610716090","en","2018-08-26","GMpaihotels","Dear Guest,

Greetings from The President Hotel!!

Thanks for your review. We would like to highlight that the 12 noon check in check out details are available with you in writing when you had done booking through the travel agent and we had extended early check in as courtesy. Any additional services taken would attract additional charges and both early check in and late check out is difficult during high occupancy especially with no prior intimation to front desk. We have communicated the same to you and agreed on additional charges.

With respect the milk served, we apologize for inconvenience and asked the concerned to change the practice.

"Adequate rooms and good service, but on a busy road","3","2018-03","2018-04-25","We stayed here for two nights to do some sightseeing in Bangalore and had booked a Comfort Room for three adults (myself, wife and daughter). However, on arrival we found that the room was quite small and adding a rollaway bed would make it very cramped. So we upgraded to a Luxury Room, which was much better, as the rollaway bed could be placed in the adjacent sitting area. The room amenities and bathroom were quite adequate. The main restaurant had a range of Indian food with a few western options and the complimentary breakfast was good. There is also a theme restaurant for lunch and dinner, the ‘Ghufa’ (Cave), which has a similar menu. The hotel is located on a busy road and the noise from the vehicle horns can be disturbing. The Lal Bagh botanical gardens and other attractions in Jayanagar area are easily accessible.

"Above average hotel","4","2018-01","2018-01-14","I would have rated this property as ""excellent"" if only the tariff were a bit more realistic.

Slightly on the expensive side and hence comparing with higher rated hotels that operate at htis tariff level.

Location is phenomenal.... bang in the middle of the beautiful Jayanagar area of Bangalore.

Rooms are comfortable and very well maintained. Staff are courteous but slightly amateurish... but its OK.

Restaurant serves pretty decent fare with good variety.

One annoying fact is that the rooms are not well insulated from road noise and since the otel is on a main road near a busy signal, the room tends to get a bit noisy.

Overall a good value for money hotel in Jayanagar.

We had food in the  Chettinad restaurent and found the food very good. I must mention that the service took quite some time. The breakfast were very good.

The hotel is pretty old fashioned but yet good for a business stay. Had dinner at their restaurant at groud floor as i wanted to have Chettinad egg curry, but have heard a lot of the restaurant at 5th floor - The Cave a jungle theme restaurant. since i came very late yet the restaurant offered me the order though they have started the preparation for breakfast. as i was dinning along and my company was booking here regularly so the manager gave me company by chit chatting about the hotel. 
The hotel rooms are good but not great but probably value for money. since this property is stone throw from my Bangalore office so mostly we get this one only","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297628-d677989-r547820994-The_President_Hotel-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","167137674","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/f6/51/8a/arti-s.jpg","50","481","1233","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArtiSingh_Travel","ArtiSingh_Travel","A936A01D1FAA40608B389869B4FCB9A1",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","ArtiSingh_Travel",,"General Manager","547962618","en","2017-12-18","SunilBM","Dear Guest,

"rare opportunity to eat outside in Mumbai","5","2016-10","2016-10-24","I didn't stay at the hotel, just ate on the roof in the Koyla restaurant, which I couldn't find listed separately. Indeed I'm not completely sure this is the same place - where I ate was at this address; Gulf Hotel, HNA Azmi Marg, Colaba, Mumbai. Take the lift almost to the top, then go up two flights of stairs.

A very good meal at reasonable prices in an extremely pleasant setting. I have been desperate to find somewhere to sit outside, which is ridiculously rare in Mumbai. I wouldn't actually have minded if the food had been poor but it seemed just fine to me. The Goan fish curry was particularly good.

Only downside for a European: no alcohol. But drink a sweet lime soda and savour life without alcohol for a change, it's not so bad (but I'd advise you to ask them to leave the salt out of the lime soda)","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d1141615-r431257810-Gulf_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1200","452389422","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","1200","9","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenwP3861TS","Stephen W","6608CC6E7213A582467AED5B7854111E",,"186225","Cambridge, United Kingdom","Cambridge","stephenwP3861TS",,"Guest Relations Manager","738390527","en","2020-01-10","gulfhotel123","Dear Guest,

The bed sheets had dirt all over them (doubt they had been washed), the bathroom filthy and the walls were covered in mould.

"Horrible","1","2014-02","2014-02-21","Do not be fooled by their website. The hotel looks nothing like it. The rooms are sweaty and damp with no windows unless  you want to pay double. There is no wifi, it's crawling with cockroaches and the staff (not the guys in the lift) are so rude and unfriendly they make you involuntarily swear. 

We arrived at 4am and left at 10am to a much nicer hotel across the road.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d1141615-r194826529-Gulf_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"1468","90943159","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/6b/ae/b7/gemma-p.jpg","1468","5","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiepee","sophie hill","F76C4E800E9A69011A4E8FF58BD90DD2",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","sophiepee",,"General Manager","802714876","en","2021-08-09","Gulf Hotel","Dear Guest, Greetings!!

"Not Bad a Stay","3","2013-02","2013-02-25","Stay at Gulf Hotel was not bad, however the MakeMyTrip website showed WiFi, and Tea and Coffee maker as a facility in this hotel, and the hotel did not provide both of these. This place is not at all a bd place for a short stay (2 nights).. The AC being centralised on the 4th floor cant be controlled (Opening the window might give some respite from the extreme chill). The staff was pretty decently mannered. We ordered snacks from the hotel canteen, which was mediocre as per the rates. Overall an average staying experience. The USP of this hotel is the locality.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d1141615-r153052369-Gulf_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html",,"3000","69835731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/29/9b/d3/prem-p.jpg","4000","12","15","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318PremP","premkumar p","69071CFD73D9478388EB2A9E49F46B72",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","318PremP",,"General Manager","802714534","en","2021-08-09","Gulf Hotel","Dear Guest, Greetings!!

"Horrendous hotel","1","2012-11","2012-11-18","Where to start with this disaster of a hotel, firstly as you enter what you think to be the reception seems more suited to a crack den. Then greeted by the most miserable receptionist I have ever encountered, without doubt the most unhelpful person I have met in India if not in life. Then taken to our room which lacked windows and the promise of hot water was not fulfilled. Upon our first night sleep we realised we had no control over our air conditioning so the room was unbareably cold and kept the 3 of us awake for hours and even resulted in a illness. The unhelpful receptionist chose to ignore our continuing phonecalls for two nights running and even began to take the mick out of us. They decided to move us to another room at 4am on our second evening, no apology or help with our belongings. The cockroach situation in both rooms  was a nightmare. When checking out we informed the receptionist of our displeasure and he shrugged and just asked for our money. Most over priced accomodation in India and by far the worst!!!!!
