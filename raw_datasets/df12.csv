"A Charming Heritage Stay That Feels Like Home in White Town","5","2025-11","2025-11-09","**A Perfect Stay in the Heart of White Town!**
We stayed at **Dune De L’Orient**, 17 Romain Rolland Street, White Town, Puducherry, from **November 4 to 9, 2025**, and it was truly a delightful experience.
First and foremost, the **location is perfect** — right in the middle of White Town and just a two-minute walk from the promenade. There are plenty of lovely cafés nearby, but their **in-house restaurant** is equally good and definitely worth trying.
Our **room was spacious and beautifully decorated** in old French style, with tall 12-foot doors and windows — comfortable enough for three people. We had originally planned to stay for just three nights, but the experience was so wonderful that we **extended our stay**. It genuinely felt like a **second home**, thanks to the warm hospitality of the staff.
A special mention to **Tulsi**, the Manager at the reception, and **Ram** at the café — all are incredibly kind and helpful. The entire staff always greeted us with smiles and were ever ready to assist. **Breakfast was excellent**, and the café served delicious food — especially the **chef’s special risotto**, which was outstanding!
Tulsi also arranged **bikes for us to explore Pondicherry** and gave great suggestions on places to visit. The **building itself is stunning**, full of heritage charm, and exudes a cozy, homely feel.
We would **love to return** to Dune De L’Orient on our next visit to Pondicherry and **highly recommend** it to anyone looking for a comfortable, charming, and memorable stay in White Town.

The check-in and check-out experience was not very smooth. 

The requests which are put well in advance are not entertained and not taken care of.

Pool is very nice, clean and well maintained. Restaurant staff and housekeeping staff are very hardworking.

Resort is far from main city so if you are expecting easy access to prime city locations like white-town and promenade then this resort is not advisable. If you want a good family time with beach access and nice pool, then this is a perfect place to stay.

Thank you for sharing such a detailed review of your stay at Le Pondy. We’re delighted to know that you enjoyed our clean, well-maintained property, the direct beach access, spacious rooms, serene pool area, and the dedicated service from our restaurant and housekeeping teams.

Regarding your feedback on the lagoon — we truly appreciate your observation. We’d like to clarify that the lagoon is under regular maintenance. The greenish layer visible on the surface is natural algae growth caused by sun exposure, which is often mistaken for mold. This ecosystem is intentionally preserved as part of our eco-friendly initiative, as it supports several forms of aquatic life and contributes to the resort’s natural balance.

Concerning your request for a lake-facing room, we understand your preference for a clearer view. Our Lake-Facing rooms are designed along the Chunnambar backwaters, surrounded by lawns and trees as part of our sustainability approach, so a fully open view is not guaranteed. Still, we were happy to shift you from the first-floor room to a ground-floor one closer to the restaurant, as per your comfort.

We also regret that your check-in and check-out experience wasn’t as smooth as expected. We’ll be reinforcing our internal coordination and pre-arrival request tracking to make future stays more seamless.

While our resort is located slightly away from the main city, it’s intentionally chosen to offer a serene and private beachside escape — away from city traffic and noise, perfect for families seeking a peaceful getaway.

Your feedback means a lot to us, and we’d love to hear any additional suggestions at gre@lepondy.in to help us serve you even better on your next visit.

"Beautiful beach resort with great food","5","2025-10","2025-10-19","My wife and I stayed at the Le Pondy for two nights to celebrate my wife’s birthday. The resort is lovely, nicely landscaped, right on the beach which is quite clean and quite private. The food at the resort is outstanding especially the local non vegetarian fare. The staff is courteous and efficient. Special mention to Pinki Gogoi at the restaurant and Densingh at the bar. They went out of their way to make our stay memorable. 
The only negative could be the location - it is 20-30mins from the White town or French quarters where all the restaurants and cafes are. However, this is still better than staying at any of the heritage places in White town as it gets very busy and noisy with a lot of local and touristy traffic there. We enjoyed the quiet and peace of Le Pondy and shuttled into White town for a couple of meals to get the best of both worlds.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g659792-d1980217-r1035507090-Le_Pondy_Beach_Resort-Pondicherry_Union_Territory_of_Pondicherry.html",,,,,,"1","19","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665pramodg","Pramod G","2CE03A400430A8134E7EBD29CC45ADF5",,,,,"665pramodg",,"Guest Relation Executive","1035609063","en","2025-10-19","Le Pondy Beach Resort","Dear Pramod,
Thank you so much for choosing Le Pondy to celebrate your wife’s birthday and for sharing such a heartwarming review. We are delighted to know that you found our beachfront resort beautiful, well-landscaped, and peaceful, and that you enjoyed the clean and private beach.

It’s wonderful to hear that you loved our local non-vegetarian cuisine and overall dining experience. Your kind mention of Ms. Pinki Gogoi from the restaurant and Mr. Densingh from the bar is truly appreciated — they will be thrilled to know their efforts made your stay memorable.

We also appreciate your feedback on the location, and we’re glad you found the distance ideal for a quiet and relaxing getaway from the busy and touristy White Town, while still being close enough to enjoy it when you wished.

Thank you once again for your kind words and for sharing such a detailed review. We hope to welcome you both back soon for another memorable stay by the beach.

"Great choice for a resort spa outside Pondicherry","4","2025-10","2025-10-07","Le Pondy is about 30 minutes south of Pondicherry and not easy to travel to or from the city without a car or taxi - it is in an isolated resort area next to a fishermen's village on the beach. If you're looking for a calm resort with great food and service, this is your place. 

The rooms are very nicely designed with front and back verandas, some with private pool. Bathrooms are luxe with walk in rain showers. The resort villas are in traditional South Indian style with thatched roofs and a long fish pond with lilies runs along the length of the resort. The grounds are well kept inside the resort. The restaurant food is excellent and the thrice daily buffet provides great value, although the repetitive muzak is rather off-putting. 

The swimming pool is certainly long but can get busy with families at times - in the morning and evening (<7pm) are quieter. The private beach is pleasant but the sea is dangerous for swimming because of the invisible shelf and undertow, there is a lifeguard on duty. Beyond the boundaries of the private beach, the sand is littered with garbage so a long walk is impractical and there was a never-ending stream of autogyro flights while I was there. 

The spa offers two types of massages - Indian Ayurvedic and ""Hoshi"", staffed by two separate teams. Hoshi offers Swedish, deep tissue and Balinese and is definitely the better choice if you know your preferences. Book ahead, appointments are only between 10am and 4pm and closed on Wednesdays. 

The staff are universally professional, courteous and helpful, especially if you're planning a sightseeing trip. Transfers are also available from Chennai airport. There is a well stocked boutique, where you can purchase handicrafts as well as sandals to wear on the beach.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g659792-d1980217-r1033817412-Le_Pondy_Beach_Resort-Pondicherry_Union_Territory_of_Pondicherry.html",,"1200","452389554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","23","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanopoulos","stanopoulos","E61789CBC0ED53A061BD68D8286AC978",,,,,"stanopoulos",,"Guest Relation Executive","1034028285","en","2025-10-08","Le Pondy Beach Resort","Dear Stanopoulos,
Thank you so much for your detailed and thoughtful review of your stay at Le Pondy. We’re delighted to know that you found our resort spa to be a great choice outside Pondicherry and appreciated the calm and peaceful surroundings. As you rightly mentioned, we are about 30 minutes from the city — the distance ensures a serene atmosphere, perfect for guests looking to unwind away from the usual hustle.

It’s wonderful to hear that you loved our rooms and villas, especially their traditional South Indian design, private verandas, and luxurious bathrooms. We take great pride in maintaining the serene landscape — from the long lily pond that runs through the property to the thatched-roof architecture that blends tradition with comfort.

We’re glad you enjoyed the restaurant food and buffet spreads, and your note about the background music has been duly noted for improvement. The swimming pool is indeed a popular spot, and your observation about quieter times is spot on. Our beach is maintained for guest comfort and safety, and we appreciate your understanding of the sea conditions — our lifeguard is always on duty to ensure guests’ safety. The autogyro flights you noticed are part of the paragliding activities offered in the adjacent property, which many adventure seekers enjoy watching or participating in.

It’s great to hear your positive feedback on our spa services as well. We’re pleased you found the “Hoshi” therapies enjoyable and professional. As an update, our spa is now open from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., and we agree that pre-booking appointments is the best way to secure a preferred time.

Lastly, we’re truly glad that you found our staff professional, courteous, and helpful — your kind words mean a lot to the entire team. Thank you once again for recognizing our efforts and for your balanced and thoughtful feedback. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back soon for another refreshing and memorable stay at Le Pondy.

"The Most Untidy Hotel Experience in Pondicherry?","3","2025-10","2025-11-03","I had high expectations, but I’m disappointed with the location, ambiance, and the room itself.  

The deluxe room I booked turned out to have a common connecting door with another room, which caused disturbance and inconvenience for both families. Given the high cost, this setup was quite unexpected.  

The room was not well maintained—one of the doors was broken, the shelf was damaged, and there were even small cockroaches in the room.  

I believe the hotel should take better care of its property and pay more attention to cleanliness and maintenance.

"Lovely, dreamt stay at the loreint!","5","2025-09","2025-09-19","It's the coziest place to be for a solo traveler. The room is like a room from a Mani Ratnam movie. Dreamy with teak furniture and green sitouts. The courtyard is a highlight too. Loved the service of tulasi, harapriya at the front desk. The cafeteria staff ramaiah was amazing too, quick to give wake up calls so i don't miss breakfast. The cafeteria manager balaram was very helpful and made sure the dishes I ordered were adeuqtaely modified to cater to the Indian tongue. Security Prabhakaran was very helpful too.
What else worked well -
Proximity to the promenade beach and ashram
What didn't work well -
The geyser is solar powered, so not the piping hot water in the bathroom. If course staff helped arrange for hot water from the kitchen
No tv and hair dryer in the room. Dryer can be provided on request.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g659792-d447002-r1031224175-Dune_de_l_Orient-Pondicherry_Union_Territory_of_Pondicherry.html",,"1200","452388139","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","1200","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightseer06656553494","Sightseer06656553494","F819B258EF1AD6977739DC67FFE112F9",,,,,"Sightseer06656553494",,"General Manager","1031531088","en","2025-09-21","DUNE DE L' ORIENT  DUNE DE L'ORIENT","Dear Guest,

"Pleasant & relaxing stay at Dune","5","2025-09","2025-09-09","We had a wonderful stay at Dune De L'orient for 3 nights. We liked the heritage aspect of the hotel and how they restored & preserved every piece of furniture. We feel transported back in time to a different era, and felt very relaxed something we were looking forward to in this trip. We stayed at Madurai the top most room. It takes a bit of climbing though to get to our room. The restaurant was a pleasant surprise as the salads and pastas tasted very well, when we had dinner there for 2 nights. We usually took a stroll from here to rock beach and several other landmarks which are all in very close proximity to the hotel.

Special mention of the staff here Priya, Tulasi, Shakti, Saran and Ram who took good care of us during our stay and made it a peaceful, relaxing one","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g659792-d447002-r1029574281-Dune_de_l_Orient-Pondicherry_Union_Territory_of_Pondicherry.html",,"1200","452392029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","4","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vamseekrishna_mvk","vamseekrishna_mvk","EF43F570A8757E6942CBE7FBECC54353",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","vamseekrishna_mvk",,"General Manager","1030906714","en","2025-09-17","DUNE DE L' ORIENT  DUNE DE L'ORIENT","Dear Guest,
