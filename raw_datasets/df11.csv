Coming to the overall service we got at the lounge and at the restaurant, was truly commendable. A big shout out to Eba for taking care of our needs and requirement. Overall all the staff were very humble and excelled at their service.
Room we had was superb, with a view to the Hussain Sagar lake and cant leave without mention about the food,  vast choice and spreads and equally tasty.

"Spoiled food and worst service","1","2025-09","2025-09-02","I stayed at the Hyderabad Marriott Convention Centre for two nights and experienced some of the worst service I've ever encountered at a hotel in India.

If you're looking to dine on spoiled food or deal with subpar hospitality, I’d recommend trying OKRA at this hotel—sadly, that’s the kind of experience they deliver. If you request anything, the waiters will either make you wait 10-15 minutes or tell you to get it yourself. At times, the head chef will show up after 20 minutes just to say ""no"" to your request.

When I raised a complaint about the spoiled food, the staff was dismissive and reluctant to address the issue. Honestly, it was a frustrating stay, and I won’t be returning.

"Bad experience","1","2025-06","2025-06-02","Despite a previous disappointing experience, I decided to give this hotel another chance, hoping for improvement. Unfortunately, it was more of the same. Upon arrival, there was a long wait at reception with no efficient system in place.

I requested to inspect the room before making payment, and it turned out the hot water wasn’t working. It took about an hour to fix the issue. After finally getting to shower, I realized the room didn’t have proper towels — only a small hand towel was provided.

Dinner was another letdown. The restaurant was swarming with mosquitoes, and the staff seemed indifferent even after I raised the issue. To make matters worse, the air conditioner in the dining area wasn’t working. At first, I was confused as to why the manager had turned on the fan — then I realized the AC was non-functional.

Even after raising these concerns, there was little urgency from the staff, and I found myself still waiting for resolutions. On top of everything, the Wi-Fi connection was extremely poor, making it hard to get anything done.

Overall, this stay was once again frustrating and far from the standard one would expect.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r1010794342-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine54338970111","Nitin M A","FBEC4E5D8AF6395549C13267BF90F697",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","Sunshine54338970111",,"Revenue Management","1013584926","en","2025-06-18","OTADIG ","Dear Sunshine54338970111,

"Great Location, Comfort, and Service at the Heart of Hyderabad","5","2025-10","2025-10-07","Stayed for a couple of days at Royalton Hyderabad, and it turned out to be a very pleasant experience. The hotel is conveniently located at Abids — close to markets, eateries, and tourist spots like Birla Mandir and Charminar.

Rooms:
Spacious, clean, and neatly maintained with a cozy bed and all essentials like tea maker, toiletries, and strong Wi-Fi. The soundproofing could be slightly better, but overall it’s very comfortable for business or family stays.

Food & Breakfast:
Their buffet breakfast was surprisingly good — a mix of South Indian dishes, fruits, eggs, and pastries. The in-house restaurant served delicious biryani and tandoori items in the evening too.

Staff & Service:
The staff is polite and attentive — check-in was smooth, and they were quick to arrange cabs and assist with luggage. The Front desk and room service team deserves appreciation for their promptness and hospitality.

Would definitely recommend Royalton Hotel if you’re visiting Hyderabad and want a blend of comfort, convenience, and good value for money.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d1785231-r1033882591-Royalton_Hotel-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452387495","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global04374467485","Global04374467485","DCABAA3261EECB3CE07D43F44CF02D56",,,,,"Global04374467485",,"General Manager","1033893977","en","2025-10-07","Samee SA","Dear Guest,

"Excellent Stay at Royalton Abids – Executive Suite & Great Service","5","2025-09","2025-09-24","I have recently stayed at Royalton Hotel, Abids, Hyderabad in the Executive Room with an in-room bathtub, and the experience was superb. The room was large, clean, and highly comfortable with the bathtub providing an added level of relaxation. The hotel is well placed in the heart of Abids and hence very convenient for shopping, dining, and visiting the major attractions in Hyderabad.

The service during my stay was excellent. A particular thank you to Mr. Srinibash, the manager, for his invaluable assistance and help during the booking process — he made everything go very smoothly and was always available.

In all, the Royalton is an excellent option for business and recreational stays, and I would happily return on my next trip to Hyderabad.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d1785231-r1031928908-Royalton_Hotel-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452389492","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps48495846834","Maps48495846834","7E1325DA2D5ABCCC35813FDB0314346F",,,,,"Maps48495846834",,"General Manager","1032007264","en","2025-09-24","Samee SA","Dear Guest,

"Poor customer service and poor facilities","2","2024-11","2024-11-21","PROS: Breakfast. 
CONS: Everything else.  
LOCATION: A few minutes from main road. 

REVIEW: 
Stayed Nov-2024 for 2 nights in Premium room with breakfast on 6th floor. It looks like a 4-5 star hotel as you arrive, doorman taking luggage from taxi to reception. Huge beautiful reception with 3 counters for different services and a travel desk nearby.

Then the horrors begin.
15 minutes to fill out foreigner forms to check-in. The 2 working lifts extremely slow in travelling, the 3rd lift was out of order for our stay. The 6th floor corridor smelt and looked like it had water damage. Room smelt musty on entering, left the fan on for a while to disperse the smell. A lot of the woodwork and in the bathroom looked mouldy from water damage.

Safety deposit box was locked. Asked reception 2 times, 1st time they said they will send someone, then they finally admitted that all safes in the hotel were locked. 
Didn’t use the mini fridge as when the fridge door was opened a blast of super-hot air hit you from inside the fridge.
Wifi not working in room after 1 hour on the first day. Reported to reception who said there were problems. No wifi for 2 days except in the reception area.

No plastic bottles of water but 2 glass bottles with resealable caps containing water. Not sure where the water originated from so did not drink it.

2nd day the key-card required reprogramming after lunch time.
2nd day room was not cleaned in the morning when we were out. It was cleaned  after 15:10pm. After returning we then noticed no towels in room at 20:25pm. We telephoned reception, housekeeping and duty manager but no reply. 
We saw and asked the housekeeper and reception but still no towels. Returned at 21:55pm and still no towels. Warm towels (from dryer I suspect) finally delivered at 22:15pm.   
Final day there was no running water at all in the morning. Reported it to reception at breakfast and it was fixed when we returned from breakfast. 

Swimming pool was not in use and under maintenance. Internet reviews show it has been like this for months. 

The biggest problem is the customer service. All the staff didn’t care and answers to questions were “5 minutes please” and nothing happened.

"Best Western Ashoka Seriously Needs to Revisit Its Standards","2","2025-10","2025-10-11","I stayed at Best Western Ashoka for two nights during a work trip. While the property itself is decent, my experience with their breakfast service was extremely disappointing.

As someone traveling for work, my mornings start early. The hotel’s breakfast timing is from 7:30 a.m. onwards, and I reached the restaurant around 7:40 a.m. on both days — yet the buffet was far from ready. Barely half of the spread was served, and most of the items I wanted weren’t available until the very end of my short breakfast window.

I brought this up at the reception on the first day and was told, rather casually, that they would “check.” Unfortunately, nothing changed the next morning. This clearly shows a lack of seriousness and respect for guests’ time, especially business travelers who follow tight schedules.

Overall, I found the staff’s attitude indifferent and the service below expectations. I would not recommend staying here if you value punctuality and professionalism.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d1152249-r1034443545-Best_Western_Ashoka-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452390050","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandTour05043421500","GrandTour05043421500","C58D79603D383458FDA8D32F65727DE6",,,,,"GrandTour05043421500",,"Guest Services / Front Office","1034893679","en","2025-10-14","ABDUL AZIZ","Dear Guest,

"Disappointing  Stay","1","2024-02","2024-02-25","Dear Management,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with our recent stay at your hotel. Unfortunately, Our Guest experience was far from the expectations one would have for a reputable establishment like yours.

From the moment I entered the premises, I was met with an overwhelming sense of disappointment. The check-in process was painfully slow, and the staff seemed disinterested in providing any form of assistance. The lack of professionalism was evident throughout my entire stay.

Upon entering my room, I was appalled by the level of cleanliness or, rather, the lack thereof. It was evident that the housekeeping staff did not prioritize cleanliness, as there were visible stains on the bedding and an overall unkempt appearance to the room. The bathroom was equally unsatisfactory, with questionable hygiene standards.

The amenities promised on your website were either nonexistent or in a state of disrepair. The so-called ""complimentary Wi-Fi"" was more of a frustration than a convenience, as the connection was consistently weak and unreliable. The fitness center, touted as a highlight of the hotel, was a collection of outdated equipment that seemed more suitable for a museum than a modern facility.

The dining experience was equally disappointing. The menu lacked variety, and the quality of the food did not live up to the prices charged. It was disheartening to see other guests sharing similar sentiments, as the atmosphere in the restaurant reflected a general sense of dissatisfaction.

In addition to the subpar accommodations, the overall ambiance of the hotel was far from welcoming. The staff's attitude towards guests appeared indifferent at best, and it was evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority.

I believe it is crucial for your management to be aware of these issues, as they significantly impact the reputation of your establishment. I sincerely hope that you take my feedback seriously and consider implementing improvements to prevent future guests from having such a disappointing experience.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to hearing about the steps your hotel will take to address these concerns.

I requested a hairdryer and was told it would be right up.  I called back 3x and each time was told it would be there in a few minutes.  I finally after 45 min went to the lobby and found out they were not going to send me the dryer as the power would overload.  Easier to let me wait with wet hair than be honest?????

"Excellent stay with personalized care","5","2025-07","2025-08-03","My mother and I stayed several nights at the Hyderabad Marriott in July. My mother was recovering from a serious illness and needed to relax and eat light, nutritious food. Tamosha and Mousumi at the restaurant always made sure that she got the food she needed, in a timely manner. When my mother was too weak to go to the restaurant, they had food sent upstairs. They always enquired about her. The service was very personal. I was exhausted from all the running around that I had to do, so I really appreciated the care. There were several others at the restaurant who took great care of us, including the chef.
Saumik, helped us move from the Courtyard to Marriott when the construction noise at the Courtyard got too much for us. The only issue we had at this hotel was the use of the gym at night, which happened to be right over our rooms. But Saumik helped us move rooms and then it was fine.
The rooms were well cared for. They were cleaned very well. I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times before (including late last year). The hotel has undergone some kind of a change, which is for the better. I found the hotel much cleaner than I had the previous times and it was better managed.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r1022475002-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangan.html",,"600","487424234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/0d/80/ea/debashris2017.jpg","600","62","285","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debashris2017","Debashri S","7E7257C01ADFF6899E3E90855F51E36F",,"60898","Atlanta, Georgia","Atlanta","debashris2017",,"General Manager","1033826935","en","2025-10-07","Amardeep Singh","Dear TripAdvisor Member,

"Excellent conference trip","5","2025-07","2025-07-15","We've just checked out of the Marriott Hyderabad after a successful and well-organised business conference week for our company. This trip was everything we had hoped for in our planning.

The hotel team was attentive, professional, and consistently supportive throughout our stay. Everything ran smoothly, from the accommodation to the conference arrangements  and our group was extremely well looked after.

A few special mentions:
Tamosha at Okra made sure we were completely cared for at every meal — her attention to detail and warmth made a real difference.
Kamal was great during the conference, always on hand to ensure we had everything we needed throughout the week.
And although we didn’t catch his name, the housekeeping staff member responsible for Room 4042 did an excellent job each day.

"The hard product may be old now, but the hotel truly excelled in its service standards","4","2025-03","2025-05-04","[Rated 4.5 stars] In India once Marriott decided to expand with full vigour it quickly became the largest foreign hotel chain in a few years time.  With their avalanche of brands, the core Marriott brand, somehow, never reached the scale it deserved.  There are still only a dozen or so hotels in India that calls itself ""Marriott Hotel"" out of more than 150 or so properties participating in Bonvoy.  The Hyderabad Marriott Hotel is surely one of the oldest such hotels, once the Viceroy Hotel, which in the 1990s was the first 5-star hotel in the city.  In fact, many of the recent Tripadvisor reviews would attest to the property's age.  Nevertheless, its central location in the city, overlooking the Hussain Sagar, almost equidistant from the old Charminar area to the posh Banjara Hills localities were always its biggest assets.  We booked a 3 nights stay here on our way to Hampi.  Moreover, being an older hotel, we actually expected the service standards to be higher, an aspect not always brought out by previous reviews.

We booked for a lake view room with queen bed that also included executive lounge access.  Our rate also had a nightly credit.   Before our travel I got in touch with the current GM Amit Sachdeva over email.  I am Bonvoy Gold, but these days its utility is pretty low, even in India, given the number of Platinum+ members around.  Although I was not expecting much, after some initial miscommunications over a system glitch, Amit upgraded us to a lake view suite for the entirety of our stay. Further, he confirmed early check-in at 11 AM and even offered the evening cocktail hours at a location where our kids could potentially join us.  Deepyayan Ghosh, the director of operations was also in touch.  Already we were having great hopes for our stay.

As we checked-in, Sreya Guha from Guest Relations was there to welcome us and take us to our room.  Deepyayan was there too to say hello.  Sreya would remain our single point of contact over Whatsapp during the rest of our stay.  This was something akin to a butler of a Ritz-Carlton or St. Regis!  The suite was very classically designed but was quite compact in size.  The door directly led into the living area which had just space for a 2-seater sofa, two end tables, a coffee table and a wooden cabinet placed against the wall that had a large smart TV.  The view from the room was of the Hussain Sagar and another single seat with a round table was placed next to it.  With a roll away bed later placed, the space here got even more restricted.  The welcome amenities placed on the coffee table was some of the best I've seen in India for a while.  Apart from the usual fruit platter, there were 8-9 varieties of desserts and candies including macarons, m&ms, cookies, while there were another 6 jars of savoury items including nuts and some very nice local snacks.  The writing desk was in the bedroom, next to a retro looking TV.  The king bed took up most of the space here.  There was a passage connecting the bedroom to the bathroom that doubled up as a walk-in closet.  The 4 fixture bathroom was brightly lit with a unique bright green coloured wall.  Although, the fixtures were rather old and the shower area had problems of water logging.

The hotel really excelled in service.  I'll give a few examples.  The first time we went back to the lobby, the GM immediately came over to say Hello.  We got to know the extensive renovation plans the property was about to undertake in two phases.  Then during the dinner my (beef) burger was not up to the mark, especially the patty smelled and tasted of low quality.  When I complained, the next day starting from the head chef to the director of operations came up to express their disappointment and promised corrective actions.  I forgot to bring a medicine, so Sreya sent out a driver all around the city to procure it, albeit unsuccessfully.  The executive lounge was rather small but they had a very good spread of food, both in hot and cold options.  They even had cocktails: a Singapore Sling was available!  Pawan and Amrapalli tried their best to keep up pace with the orders.  Chef Satish was in the middle of all this.  He would frequently come over to check upon us and would suggest things to order if we were unsure.  The housekeeping on their part would keep a new towel art each day on the bed, plus there were loads of chocolates for the kids too.

The best was saved for the last day.  My wife went for a spa but she came back quite dissatisfied, including lack of privacy, was noisy, faulty lighting, all of which contributed to a rather mediocre experience.  Although, the service itself was probably okay.  When my wife narrated the incident to Sreya, she investigated and got the full spa charges waived off.

The breakfast options were good.  They had excellent south Indian options including some incredible pesarattus that we would have in multiples each morning.  We tried their ongoing Bohra food festival at the speciality restaurant Bidri.  The food was very good and it was further elevated by a live santoor performance.  In general, with so many food options available in the city we didn't dine extensively at the hotel.  But whatever we had, maintained good standards except the occasional issues.

We made an early check-out to catch our flight to Hampi.  There was a slight issue with one of our room rates, which was eventually sorted after I managed to show the original email.  In general, whatever shortcomings the hotel seemed to have definitely stemmed from the age of its hard product.  The service standards were top notch, perhaps comparable to properties one level higher.  With the promised renovations, I can't wait to see how its hard product evolves and whether it can reclaim its lost position as the best 5 star property in the city.  A TripAdvisor 5 star rating would surely follow.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r1005794530-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangan.html",,"50","177181968","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/8f/95/10/arnab-s.jpg","50","84","186","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArnabSam","Arnab S","934CF79F7AB3BCF5904CBD972513AF4C",,"12392950","Bangalore District, India","Bangalore District","ArnabSam",,"General Manager","1038449423","en","2025-11-10","Amardeep Singh","Dear TripAdvisor Member,

We ask to talk to manager and were told he already left will come in morning. The room was disgusting and smell was unbearable so we left hotel and donated 8000INR to them. They were okay with us leaving without bothering to ask what wrong. Then the security guy told that manager is sleeping in his room in hotel itself.

"Katriya is one of the disgusting place with pathetic staff","1","2023-10","2023-10-17","This hotel is just a weird one , we requested fir an early check-in and they did not help us and mentioned even if we have a room you will have to pay for it even if you want to check in an hour before. There check in time was freaking 2pm. Me and my friends were sitting there from 7:30 a.m. and we were so tired. We requested the management to help us but all they did was asked us to sit in the lounge.
As we were tired one of my friend just slept and the minute he closed his eyes the receptionist came and rudely said that please sit properly like are you serious! 
They did not even offered us juice or water and the management was really very rude especially the male receptionist, giving us looks and not even offered water,we had to request for that and they gave 2small bottles for 3people.

Ultimately we had to leave as they were misbehaving and cancel our booking and search for another hotel.

Don't book the hotel without reviewing thoroughly like we did and i guess our luck was bad either.
Katriya hotel really sucks instead book a bloom hotel early for good prices and avoid such shady disgusting place.

"DO NOT STAY. PLEASE READ THE FULL REVIEW.","1","2023-06","2023-06-09","The experience was absolutely horrible. So, I arrive at the hotel at 1430h, the lobby looks like a fish market. The air conditioning is not working. My stay was prebooked and paid for 7 days, the hotel refused to check me in because they had no rooms available. They tell me “sir please wait for 5 minutes to prepare your room” those 5 minutes ultimately turn into 3 hours, waiting in the heat with no air conditioning, and suffocation because of so many people in the lobby. I ended up leaving the hotel for good. 

This entire thing happened because some pigs (politicians) from the congress party were refusing to check out for the past 5 hours. Why not call the cops on them and kick them out. Politicians are not even paying the full amount of the rent which we are paying. Why give them priority over other customers?

And this is not only my story, many other guests, families with children, women with medical problems and the elderly all facing this in the lobby since before I arrived. 

Check out time was 1130h
Check in starts after 1400h
And no one was checked in till I left (1800h)

Special Mention to the on duty manager Mr. Srikanth who is an A grade @$$h0L€ who has no sense on how to speak to someone.

I had booked through booking.com and had almost checked-in at 9-30 pm when after over-hearing a lady guest complaining at the reception about water seepage in the room she was staying, I decided to check the condition of the room before hand. The walls along the corridor leading to the room had seepage marks. I also visited the toilet in the lobby area on ground floor but just couldn't use it as most of the commodes were over-flowing with excreta and horrific smell around. Quite a few other residents were also complaining about inadequate AC in their rooms. Finally I had to book a room at Radisson Blu and checked-in there though at a higher tariff but it was worth the money.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed our hospitality, friendly staff, and diverse buffet options. Providing a comfortable and memorable experience for our guests is always our top priority.

We regret that we weren’t able to provide you with seamless experience due to inconvenience caused to you because of the smell that you experienced in the hotel which overflows from the lake on the outskirts. Unfortunately, while the core of the issue exits outside the hotel there is very little that we can do to control the same however I assure you that in order to mitigate this smell within the hotel we have already taken some steps such as partnering with Scent Air a global company expert in mitigating bad odor inside the buildings and also a fragrance company. We are confident by doing so we would be able to reduce this issue significantly and improve our overall guest experience that currently gets marred because of the same

We hope to welcome you back soon for an even better experience. If there’s anything else we can do to assist you, please feel free to reach out.

Best Regards

Amit Sachdeva

The Ugly: this hotel still uses a lot of plastic.. plastic  water bottles in rooms have disappeared in all good hotels but here there were 6 in my room.

"Mixed Experience, but Great Potential","3","2024-10","2024-10-03","I recently stayed at the Hyderabad Marriott Hotel & Convention Centre, and while there were some ups and downs, the overall experience was decent, with room for improvement.

Check-in Experience:
The check-in process was good and smooth, with no hassles. The staff was friendly and quick, making it a pleasant start to my stay.

Cleanliness and Appearance:
The hotel is clean and elegantly maintained. The overall aesthetic of the place was impressive and well-kept.

Dinner (Day 1):
My first night’s dinner experience was disappointing. No one attended to the tables until I brought it to the manager’s attention. The food served was cold and didn’t feel fresh, and the overall service was slow. Tables weren’t set properly, and I had to ask for basic things like cutlery and plates. This could have been handled much better.

Rooms:
The rooms are spacious, well-equipped, and comfortable. However, none of the rooms in the hotel are soundproofed, which meant I could hear a lot of noise from the corridor and other guests. Fortunately, the duty manager was very cooperative and understanding and shifted me to a room on a higher floor. Unfortunately, the behavior of other noisy guests is something beyond the hotel’s control.

Corridor:
The corridors were well set but noisy, as explained earlier. This was one of the main drawbacks.

Laundry:
The laundry service could be improved, particularly with ironing. The clothes were not pressed properly, which was disappointing.

Breakfast (Day 2):
Breakfast was a positive experience. The food was fresh with many options, and the staff was attentive this time, which was an improvement from the previous evening.

Room Service and Guest Services via Phone:
This was another area that could use improvement. The room service was slow and often unresponsive. I requested a shaving kit, which never arrived, even by the time I checked out. Additionally, many of my calls to guest services went unanswered.

Dinner (Day 2):
Dinner on the second night was a much better experience. The service was great, the tables were well set, and the staff was attentive. The managers even came by to apologize for the previous night’s issues, which I appreciated.

Surroundings:
While the hotel’s surroundings are quiet, there’s a noticeable foul sewage smell from the nearby Hussain Sagar Lake. Unfortunately, this isn’t something within the hotel’s control, but it did affect the overall experience.

Spa:
The spa services were excellent and highly professional. This was definitely one of the highlights of my stay.

Gym and Pool:
Unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to explore the gym or pool, so I can’t comment on those facilities.

Coffee Shop:
The coffee shop is a must-visit. I highly recommend trying the chicken puff—it was a delightful surprise and exceeded my expectations.

Overall:
The hotel staff was responsive when I brought any issues to their attention, and they are friendly and eager to help. If they can iron out a few small issues, it would greatly improve the guest experience. I recommend this hotel for a short stay, though some of the larger problems, such as noise and the lake’s smell, are beyond the staff’s control.

Kudos to (mostly) everyone one who attended to me, and special mention to Saqib who tried his best to make my stay comfortable. Really appreciate it keep it up.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r972374216-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1244","766551130","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b0/a4/5a/caption.jpg","1242","1","34","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gauranshg","GG","F6E7D835580C15EDADEEBB106034481E",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","gauranshg",,"General Manager","972607029","en","2024-10-04","Amit Sachdeva","Dear Gauransh,

"Worst Hotel ever stayed Please don't try if they offer for free of cost","1","2022-06","2022-06-29","I have booked a hotel through Agoda.com after reviewing from the site of the hotel Katriya room pictures and details in Hyderabad city for 24th June to 26th June. Total 5 rooms booked for 3 nights.
The moment when we entered the room, we have realized that we got cheated. The filthy room and corridor, poor bathroom with ugly toilets, there is no basic items like bucket and Mug, tea bags, sugar, kettles, etc..
The issue was the toilet, one of the worst toilet ever seen in my life is in Hotel Katriya Hyderabad. We have went back to reception and asked them to change the room and they refused. I have asked for the refund so that we can find any good hotel but the answer was to contact the booking site customer care since it was booked online,which is not in India and we couldn't dial from phone as the customer care is in Thailand. My childrens were not ready to use the toilets and my friends were insulted me through out the trip and spoiled my reputation with them for taking the responsibility to study online and book the hotel which I did.
My argument is why Agoda is selling such a dirty property which even not maintaining the minimum hotel standard? Why there is no customer care in case of any emergency issues?
Agoda  posted a pictures of edited version of hotel rooms and facility to attract customers and reality is different. The hotel is substandard hotel and the amenities are worst and poor . Looks the property was not done any maintenance for last few years..there is no room service for this property, most of the time we walked to the stores to get sugar, soap, tea bag etc..ourself and even they were not aware about that.
We have requested several times to change all 5 rooms and they refused and not answered. Great disappointment and I would like to proceed further to stop this practice to cheat people once the booking done through online. We have spent more Rs60,000/- for hotel and result is spoiling the journey..My suggestion is bring this issue to the concerned department and to take actions on these online platform to control cheatings.

Geyser, the water boiler, the exhaust in the washroom all were in non working condition. Inspite of repeated requests no one turned up to help us out with it. Finally after complaining to the manager they changed our room to 421. But the sad part was this room was no better than the previous one. With even the intercom phone in non working condition. Very poor response from the staff. They are very casual and absolutely not bothered about guiding us with the things. Breakfast buffet was fine with not too exorbitant prices. Would tell my friends and relatives to never book this hotel. No value for money.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r842482627-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452392461","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg","1200","2","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UDMAAM","Udmaam","4C407214803DE43C2A33770F677025F1",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","UDMAAM",,,,,,,,"8 Raj Bhavan Road Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500082 India","Hyderabad","India","500082","Telangana","8 Raj Bhavan Road","Somajiguda","583459","17.42478","Hyderabad, Hyderabad District, Telangana","78.459526","Katriya Hotel & Towers","981","3.3","234","82","138","211","316","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297586-d583459-Reviews-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html","http://www.katriyahotel.com/index.html"

"Worst hotel saw in my life tome","1","2021-09","2021-09-12","This is worst maintained hotel. It looks good only on pictures. I stayed for 3 nights and faces humiliation. Please don’t book. Below are Pros and Cons-

Pros -
1) Sent help to take our luggage to room and he (Bhushan) was good.
2) No other pros

Cons -
1) As soon as I entered the room almost all lights were off except 1-2. Reception took 20 minutes to assign room.
2) We started to walk to room and the passage/ corridor was in repair condition full of dust.
3) Entered room and noticed bad smell and dust. Requested to change room. Room was shifted.
4) Everywhere bad smell and dust. No AC working which was complained by other rooms also.
5) All electrical fittings inside rooms are broken and can’t charge mobile also.
6) No WiFi and AC.
7) They take advance for extra bed and need to clear food bill immediately. They don’t return your change promptly.
8) No proper food. Only minimum items.
9) Staff not that great for customer focused.
10) Bathrooms are not good and water blocked inside tubs. Everyday you should call maintenance. Not hot water, only warm water morning only.

Over all it was worst experience in my life. I never write bad about someone as it might not be intentional. But here, no single positive point.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r809712177-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452390771","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meetviky","meetviky","E5886F3DCA9A5682880BDE6185B2E0DE",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","meetviky",,,,,,,,"8 Raj Bhavan Road Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500082 India","Hyderabad","India","500082","Telangana","8 Raj Bhavan Road","Somajiguda","583459","17.42478","Hyderabad, Hyderabad District, Telangana","78.459526","Katriya Hotel & Towers","981","3.3","234","82","138","211","316","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297586-d583459-Reviews-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html","http://www.katriyahotel.com/index.html"

"Good experience, excellent value for money","5","2020-01","2020-02-08","I recently stayed one night at this hotel. Booked through Agoda from USA, prepaid. My experience was good. I went with optimism as most of the Indian reviewers are negative minded. At the reception Jeevan was considerate and polite. He allowed me to check in after 10:30 am without any extra charge. The hotel was not the main road, which is a good thing with no noise. The entrance and lobby areas were good. The room was acceptable with one large queen bed and all the necessary amenities, including soap/shampoo and variety of TV channels. Everything was working including A/C. There was out door swimming pool, which I did not use for lack of time. The fitness room was adequate with adequate equipment. I was able to use it and the attendant was helpful and showed how to do exercises. In the lobby Das was very helpful as well and give me the needed newspapers. The complimentary buffet breakfast excellent, it had both Western and Indian breakfast items including variety of fruits. The wifi worked well in the lobby, but it did not work in the room. It was good in a way that I was not wasting time on the internet. I will happily return if I had to visit Hyderabad again. This is my first visit, to the capital though I lived part of my childhood in AP. I booked a 8 hour taxi for day tour. I was hesitant initially as it was already 1pm, but at the end it worked out fine. I was able to see a few attractions by 8 pm. Overall it was a good experience, except people speak Urdu/Hindi first than speaking their mother tongueTelugu.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r743793354-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"205","19820636","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/5c/avatar034.jpg","205","10","20","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinnath","robinnath","3AE7A538F44C0C5104B11777EB420B73",,"46028","Bow, New Hampshire","Bow","robinnath",,"Front Office Manager","744754675","en","2020-02-12","GM-Katriya-Hotel","Dear Guest,

"Comfortable hotel","3","2019-12","2019-12-31","We checked into Katriya Hotel & Towers in Dec 2019 for a vacation. Overall the Hotel is a fine property. The lobby is very warm and welcoming, the Cafe is also welcoming with warm lighting. The Hotel has 10 Conference Centres accommodating from 10 pax to over 2000 pax. The rooms are also comfortable with warm diffused lighting. WiFi is quite strong to be available in the room without disruptions. The breakfast buffet menu is large with live stations for eggs and dosa. The menu is changed daily so a wide variety without repeats is available. The food is also above average.

The flip side of the Hotel is that the double beds though Queen size are quite narrow and uncomfortable for a couple to relax properly. We had to insist on transferring into a room with twin beds to be able to have a good night's rest.

The Hotel also needs to renovate its bathrooms. Most of the fixtures are stained badly, the exhaust fans do not work, hot water generally is only tepid, WC seats are not fixed properly. Once the bathrooms are renovated it will add huge value to the property.

The staff needs to be acknowledged for their co-operation, and efficiency. They really do add value to the property.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r735974610-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1536","84159695","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/04/2c/cf/kaustubhdharkar.jpg","2048","27","125","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaustubhDharkar","KaustubhDharkar","E21E279FB74CCABC096DC8406F4EE6F9",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","KaustubhDharkar",,"Front Office Manager","736697054","en","2020-01-03","GM-Katriya-Hotel","Dear Guest,

"In short: Old hotel with poor maintenance. ","2","2019-12","2019-12-17","I had stayed in this hotel for one night. Was on a Business trip and this is the hotel provided to us. 
Pros:
The staff at reception are courteous.
Ambiance at the lobby is good.
Good WiFi Speeds
Breakfast is ok. (But, they opened up a little late than they mentioned. May be it’s odd event)
Cons:
No bell boy ( I didn’t have much luggage, but a bell boy showing round the room and making sure everything is working is needed)
2 out of 3 Lifts are out of order (unfortunately 2nd lift failed with me inside. The staff inside the lift was literally trying to force close the partially closed automatic doors so that the lift works)
The wooden floor in my room was squeaky. 
No locker in the room. (All Star hotels have these.)
TV Not connected. Had to figure out the plug points.
Remotes with out the batteries.
No hand shower or bucket and a mug. Had to shower only, that to, standing in a tub that is squeaky.
No floor mat in the bathroom or just outside the bathroom to dry your feet.
Hot water not hot at all. Warm at the max.
Some switch boards are broken.
No coat hangers. (Almost all hotels, even 3stars have these these days)

I don’t know how many of these cons and pros are oddities. It is an old hotel. But with bad maintenance. I have been to many old hotels. With good maintenance, they are almost as equivalent as new ones in experience, and would recommend many such. But I cannot recommend this hotel.

"Never ever book","1","2019-12","2019-12-03","I have opted this hotel, as it was close to the my place of visit, As I was travelling with my parents booked a Club room expecting more space in the room and better services.
But its almost like a Standard room, when I checked with the Hotel staff they said the difference is only the interiors between club and standard rooms. 

Interiors - Torn curtains, leaking washroom taps, cracked bathtub, Broken bed lamps ...

Housekeeping at its worst, Room phone never worked, They changed the room after I spoke to the Manager, then the second room was bit better than the first one but after sometime the phone never worked. 
Literally I used to call reception from my Mobile to speak to the staff. After so many complaints the problem never sorted. 
To order food for my parents from the room service, I was calling from outside to reception to send a Room Service Boy to take order. But nothing happened.
So I had literally cancelled my meeting and rushed back to hotel and make them to take order for the Lunch.
Disastrous stay service... I never ever suggest anyone to book even though you don't have an option.
Its a property NOT WORTH for your MONEY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r730552273-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452387402","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg","1200","25","24","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajaKiran","Raja Kiran","2DDC1DE8659101E86660FBBAF1391772",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","RajaKiran",,"General Manager","730927588","en","2019-12-05","GM-Katriya-Hotel","Dear Guest,

Where do I start from the first room given was an upgrade from Club Room to Tower Room. Room was never checked by Housekeeping department. Within 30 hour ensured was given a new room. We were shifted to Suite Room which also was a shocker. Imagine when guests have to ask reception for every small facility which should be available & not asked for after checkin.

,"1","2025-07","2025-07-19","I stayed at Best Western Ashoka from 6th July to 18th July. Unfortunately, I must say that the quality has gone down significantly compared to earlier experiences.

First, a special mention of appreciation to some excellent staff:

Madhuri from Housekeeping,

Naresh at the Reception,

Rakesh from Room Service, and

Naseem from Security/Driving – all of them were extremely supportive and courteous.

However, we faced several serious issues during our stay:

Insensitive Room Allocation: Despite clearly mentioning my 100% visual impairment, I was initially allotted a room on the 3rd floor. Only after 10 days, someone came and asked us to shift rooms due to “AC repair work starting the next day.” Later we found out that the entire floor was being vacated for government officials, and we were given false reasons.

Misleading Commitments by Management: When we raised this with Mr. Javid, Vice President of the hotel, he admitted that the government booking was made 30 days ago and claimed we were informed at the time of our booking – which is not true. He then offered us complimentary laundry service to make up for the inconvenience and asked us to submit our bags for washing and ironing.

Laundry Charge Scam: We followed instructions and submitted our laundry the next day, clearly informing the staff again that it was to be treated as complimentary, as told by Mr. Javid. Yet, in the evening, they said the laundry service was chargeable and demanded ₹3,600. After multiple rounds of explanation and disappointment, they brought it down to ₹2,200, saying that only some items were complimentary.

This experience was not just unprofessional, but also dishonest. It’s really unfortunate when you’re told something verbally, only to be denied or misled later. My strong advice: do not believe any verbal commitments—always insist on written confirmation.

As a person with disability, I felt uncared for and deeply disrespected. There was a lack of awareness, training, and empathy in handling guests with special needs.

To sum up:
Best Western Ashoka felt more like “Waste” Western Ashoka this time. I sincerely hope the management wakes up and improves their integrity and disability awareness.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d1152249-r1019493917-Best_Western_Ashoka-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452387345","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H6768MMnaveenk","naveen k","C911E147B4CFEFD06EC092DF17643107",,"12389092","Hyderabad District, India","Hyderabad District","H6768MMnaveenk",,"Guest Services / Front Office","1020565402","en","2025-07-24","ABDUL AZIZ","Dear Sir,

It was unfortunate to know that there ws a misunderstanding in communication. We informed you that there was a Garment Exhibition booking on the same floor and and not any Government Booking. Keeping in mind your comfort, we had requested you for a shift of room to another floor as there will be visitors coming for the exhibition and it would be inconvenient for you to stay in the same floor. As a gesture of goodwill we had clearly informed you that whatever unpacked clothings are there in the room , will be laundered and placed in your new room and we had kept our commitment. But the following day again you had given 35 pieces for laundry and expected it be be complimentary, which was actually very difficult to oblidge. However keeping in mind about your dissatisfaction.                                            we had offered you a discount on the laundry bill during the settlement which completely shows our empathy.  With due respect to the feedback that you have given, may we request you to kindly remove the same as the facts mentioned are not real and and misleading.

"GREAT STAFF AND COOL AMBIENCE!","5","2024-02","2024-02-29","I along with my wife visited Hyderabad from 25th -28th Feb 2024 and we stayed at the Royalton Hotel. We were staying in Room No. 123 and  I am pleased to say that our stay there was extremely comfortable and pleasant. There are so many things that we loved about this place. To start, the location of the hotel is very convenient to reach. It is located in one of Hyderabad's most premium locations and one can reach most of the landmarks easily from here. Secondly, the hospitality provided by the hotel staff beginning from the guards at the gate to the valet drivers, to the front desk and the servers is truly exceptional. The staff was not only polite and courteous but also prompt and quick in responding to any service calls or any requirements of the guests.  The staff was cooperative in every way possible and made sure that both of us felt at home and completely at ease during our stay. Talking of the service we were particularly impressed by the behavior and nature of the lady at front desk Ms. Mona Kashyap. She was always smiling and always ready to assist and guide us. Her cheerful countenance and her welcoming demeanor was exemplary.
 
In addition to this, I would also like to comment about the food and the overall vibe of the hotel. Here I must appreciate the effort of the kitchen staff for providing delicious breakfast and food in general. There's plenty of variety and something for every taste bud. And for the ambience I must say that everything was neat and clean and had a breezy and relaxed feel about it. 

So, all in all it was a positive experience and a memorable one for us. Both of us being senior citizens, needed that little extra and were really pleased by the way which everyone looked after us. Would recommend the hotel to everyone.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d1785231-r940201206-Royalton_Hotel-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452387345","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg","1200","1","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saurabhsteel","SaurabhS","0287A97661130B0940DB439E1D03592B",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","saurabhsteel",,"General Manager","940512385","en","2024-03-01","Samee SA","Dear Guest,

"Mouldy rooms and loud music. Would not return.","1","2024-01","2024-01-15","I don’t really know where to start here but had a terrible experience staying at this hotel. I have been travelling around India for over a month now and easily the worst place I have stayed. Dirty rooms, air con unit (filters) have obviously never been cleaned and visible mould on the curtains and other areas of the room. General room very tired and bedding old. The whole room was uncomfortable and the smell of mould was overwhelming. I left with a cold and both my partner and I feeling unwell. Our room wasn’t cleaned one of the days and I had to call the reception three times to get some water and more toilet roll before it was actually seen to. One of the worst parts of the stay was being kept awake until 4am in the morning from loud drum and bass music from a party going on in one of the hotels function rooms below. I don’t expect to pay to stay in a hotel and not able to get some rest. When the reception staff called us at 11am in the morning to ask when we were checking out (check out time 12) was the most frustrating of them all, especially when we had slept for a few hours only. No apologies from the hotel when we told them about this. Don’t be fooled by the high end price which is always discounted, it’s a one star stay. Would never recommend a stay here, there are better places to stay. 

Postives: we enjoyed the bar and bar staff friendly and accommodating. The shower has warm water.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d1785231-r934190084-Royalton_Hotel-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lois_s16","lois_s16","6F3125A57B0753C91E576E8EEE7BA804",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","lois_s16",,"General Manager","934553650","en","2024-01-17","Samee SA","Dear Guest,

"very nice & comfortable stay","4","2019-10","2019-10-25","I have stayed in this hotel for almost 8 days during my Hyderabad tour. The hotel is quite renowned because it was a famous hotel. Now this hotel lost his glory for many reasons, but still overall a nice hotel. Few of the points now I am highlighting below :

It has a huge parking space & may accommodate 100 cars.
rooms are quite big & specious.
I did not take the breakfast or dinner, so for me difficult to comment on this.
the hotel needs serious renovation or maintenance. May be one of the reason for this hotel low footfall. Inside the rooms, electrical works is very poor & it can be risky for children.
Staffs are good, but room service is very poor. I usually called them 4-5 times & then only they attain.
location of this hotel is very good & nearby you will find many tea stall, medicine, lunch or dinner.

Finally, after few drawbacks, this hotel is good for staying.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r721188582-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"2048","452914219","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/fe/ec/2b/anirban19812015.jpg","2048","50","153","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anirban19812015","Anirban19812015","996CFB75019191B0BDB242DF57B0A7C5",,"503692","Guwahati, India","Guwahati","Anirban19812015",,"General Manager","721940098","en","2019-10-28","GM-Katriya-Hotel","Dear Guest,

"Great food ....","4","2018-11","2019-10-18","Stayed here for 4 days with a group of 25 people on Hyderabad Trip. The room services were very disappointing but the food was a class apart. The lavish buffet is the cherry on the CAKE . The staff pretty decent … whatever you say they will revert with a yes madam … even if they were not in a position to deliver the same … & then after the second reminder they will come back with your requirement. But we friends loved the food … quality , taste & the overall layout… Their restaurant saved them from the bad experience we had from their services…","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r719393110-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452392144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","1200","36","300","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NEETADAM","NEETADAM","AA8EC23668ECB6DA91F0CB427EFF1741",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","NEETADAM",,"General Manager","720044747","en","2019-10-20","GM-Katriya-Hotel","Dear Guest,

"Horrendous, not even worth 1 star!","1","2019-07","2019-10-16","You have to be kidding me. 
I don't know where to start: From rooms stinking of pesticides, to the AC not working, for the duration of the 3 hours I was there. 
All that I did during my 3 hours there is supervise the maintenance team ""try"" to fix the Air Conditioning. 

The reception is a very deceptive representation of what the actual hotel is, in terms of the quality.
I eventually cancelled my booking, as I was tired from all the travel. 

The food at the hotel is also very substandard.

The employee assisting me with my baggage agreed that there were a lot of customers that are upset with the room.

Oh, and let's not even talk about the bathroom and the toilet. Public toilets are better maintained. The toilet and the ""bath tub"" was moulded, with god alone knows what!

Not sure how the hotel is still rated 3.6, but please, if anyone is considering booking this, PLEASE DO NOT. I do not want anyone to experience what I did.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r718976637-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArjunN136","Arjun Nair","BE1EE0A8FAA7CB0A95F0BE8EBA99F69A",,,,,"ArjunN136",,"General Manager","721902721","en","2019-10-27","GM-Katriya-Hotel","Dear Guest,

One of the highlights of my stay was the lavish Rasa breakfast buffet. It featured an impressive spread of over 30 items, including South Indian, North Indian, and Continental dishes – all delicious and beautifully presented.

The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city, making it easy to access major attractions and destinations. The rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean, and very comfortable.

I requested her to change the room when available and Sushmita never got back to me during my 3 nights stay. She was highly unprofessional in terms of hospitality with our group members. She was full of attitude as if she owned the place. 
Buffet was arranged for our group in different halls. Quality and taste was horrible. Cups were not clean , fruits were stale at times, breads were undercooked, there was delay in refilling dishes & breads , so on & so forth. 
The hospitality was very poor. They behaved as if they were doing some favour to us.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r963697190-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452387615","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg","1200","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AARSHIYABHUTANI","Arshiya","4C7C2BCDDF9EED9A30B7889D64B6A2A4",,,,,"AARSHIYABHUTANI",,"General Manager","964036289","en","2024-08-09","Amit Sachdeva","
Dear Ms. Bhutani,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor. We genuinely appreciate your insights.

Regarding your concerns, the hotel strictly adhered to the terms of contract with the conference partner. The room allocation was communicated to the organizers as per the booking category. The room you received was one of our best available at the time. Any limitations in upgrading your room were not due to a lack of consideration but rather a commitment to the contract and limited availability of Lake view rooms. 

For the meal venues, all details were finalized before the conference. Due to prior commitments, last-minute changes were not feasible. The conference representative tasted the food before each meal period and provided feedback, which was dutifully acted upon. 

We strive to maintain high standards in all aspects, including food quality. We would have appreciated any immediate feedback on the meals to address your concerns promptly.

Thank you again for your feedback. We look forward to the opportunity to better serve you in the future.

Kind regards,

Amit Sachdeva

"It is a delightful place to reside with a truly magnificent location.","5","2024-08","2024-08-03","The hotel is situated on the banks of Hussain Sagar Lake in Hyderabad, offering a central location with convenient access to various points of interest. While traffic congestion is a challenge throughout the city, the hotel's location provides a balance between accessibility and tranquility.

The guest rooms are well-appointed and equipped with all the expected amenities of a five-star hotel, including bathtubs. The staff demonstrates exceptional courtesy and helpfulness, ensuring a pleasant and comfortable stay for guests.

Ample parking facilities are available for guests' convenience. The hotel offers a variety of dining options, including Okra, which serves a buffet breakfast, Bidri, an Indian restaurant, a bar located on a higher level, a bakery, and a coffee shop in the lobby. The culinary offerings cater to a diverse range of dietary preferences, including vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and vegan options.

The hotel features a swimming pool and walking areas around the building, providing opportunities for relaxation and exercise. However, it is worth noting that the open spaces are affected by an unpleasant odor emanating from a nearby canal or stream of polluted water that flows along the hotel's boundary.
Overall, it was a very pleasant stay for us & we highly recommend it to others.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r963025797-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"205","19820681","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/89/avatar010.jpg","205","50","184","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peeushanand","peeushanand","08D1EFAEA0F6AAD21CF4D931BC1F1ABB",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","peeushanand",,"Marketing","963437475","en","2024-08-06","Hydmc marketing","Dear Guest,

"Property is at an amazing location overlooking Grand Hussain Sagar Lake, picturesque indeed. Enjoy a good walk on necklace road.","5","2024-06","2024-06-04","Well, nothing beats the location of this property overlooking the grand Hussain Sagar Lake. 32 year old property but for sure maintained very well by Marriott. It would have had been the best one during its time and now also it is rated one of the best in Hyderabad but for sure it needs a renovation or makeover. Have been to Hyderabad many times, somehow, missed staying here earlier. 

Well decked up, lake facing room on 6th floor was indeed a breather, thanks to Swati Dey for very smooth checkin experience and taking care of my requests. You are doing good Swati, keep contributing best you can and keep rising the success ladder.

Buffet working Lunch at Okra restaurant was bit of a task as I and my guest, both of us were sweating like anything hing since AC was not working, mentioned to the team, they probably tried fixing it but all in vain. This was certainly a pain😞😞. 

Thanks to Sarvesh, Sanjiv, Bikramjeet and Vimlesh for taking care of orders during the lunch and breakfast.

Devika, thanks for the clean room, good luck for your future endeavours. 

Samaresh, munchies and fruits that you brought were really good ❤️ liked almost all of them. Quite often I miss to even taste these offering in my room but this time, I enjoyed. Thanks Subba for helping with my luggage. 

Recomend dining at Altitude Bar on top floor while you enjoy amazing view. Clicked a few pics, which say it all❤️❤️.

Will explore Bidri restuarant next time.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r953702439-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1420","795415841","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/69/15/21/caption.jpg","1419","130","805","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PawanKGupta","PawanKGupta","55C9412EB73B1BF21E8988809AE00A21",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","PawanKGupta",,"General Manager","1038451817","en","2025-11-10","Amardeep Singh","Dear TripAdvisor Member,

"Very Good Experience","4","2024-05","2024-05-13","I recently stayed at ""Hyderabad Marriot Hotel and Convention Centre"" a Lakeside Retreat, a gem nestled near the picturesque Hussain Sagar Lake. 

The hotel’s location is its greatest asset. However, the Property is a bit old but it is situated right on the banks of Hussain Sagar Lake, it offers breathtaking views of the water, especially during morning and evening hours.

Spacious Rooms with All Amenities
The rooms at Lakeside Retreat are nothing short of luxurious. They are spacious, elegantly designed, and meticulously maintained. The plush beds, soft linens, the rooms come equipped with all modern amenities, including high-speed Wi-Fi, a flat-screen TV, refrigerators, iron, iron stand, a safe, dryer, coffee tea maker stocked up, complimentary water bottle etc.

Warm Hospitality and Polite Staff
The hotel staff deserves special mention. Their warm hospitality and genuine care for guests make all the difference. From the front desk to the housekeeping team, everyone wears a smile and goes the extra mile to ensure a comfortable stay. 

Always Welcoming Faces
What struck me most was the consistent warmth of the staff. Whether it was the morning breakfast buffet or for any other service their faces were always welcoming. It’s these small gestures that create lasting memories.

Although it was a quick business trip however, I left with a sense of rejuvenation and a promise to return soon.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r950666649-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"450","476451137","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/66/11/41/avatar.jpg","450","18","1349","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshiRoutes","Paramjeet Singh","289298858269FF036FE50654EDD924E6",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","SunshiRoutes",,"Marketing","952715273","en","2024-05-28","Hydmc marketing","Dear Guest,

"Minus 5 rating !!!! Highly not recommended !!!","1","2019-08","2019-08-17","Worse experience ever. We checked in at night because of our flight was reached by night. We checked in at 1pm. They give us room which is of worse condotion. Then after our complain thet give us another room. Which is more worst. Even the plates of food were resides in passage only. So the smell was yukkk. After 2pm they finally gave us room.but that to have in not good condition. Here the AC was not working well. We complained twice per day. But the answer was common, this will work like this only. Next day after 2 hours also we didnt get cooling in room. So we complained about it. His technicians come and check and than was laughed and said like yeh toh aise hi chalta hain apko pata nahi hain. He behaved like we never seen AC before. Behaviour of staff is not at all supportive. Two other things i would like mention. Never order sandwich here.. They will give you 225 rs sandwich which have tomato and mayonise only inside and of two pieces only. And do not use kettle of tea, i found insects inside. Which arise due to not cleaning properly.

"Avoid at any cost","2","2019-07","2019-07-28","First do not confuse this property with the nice and plush Kakatiya Sheraton nearby!

This is a different world altogether.

The moment you get down from your car you know you have reached a hotel which seriously need to be upgraded.

A staircase is waiting for you to climb up with your luggages to reach the lobby, that too if you manage to push the huge and heavy wooden framed glass door!

No one would approach you to help! But that’s fine, we don’t expect these outside India.

But, hey, no one would do the necessary security check before you enter the lobby.

The lobby is large, smells of a bygone era without any heritage charm, though!

You reach the reception desk and realise the lone lady is already overworked and engrossed with check out formalities of another guest and there was no one to help her in that large reception!!!

If you are in a hurry for your lecture or after a long flight too exhausted to stand even, just meditate and remember nothing is permanent! 

You may politely raise your voice, that would complicate the matter.

Some junior staff will come forward to help with check out, yes, before you actually checked in!!!

Now after a good(actually bad) 15 minutes that lady would reach you and then you will realise they are still stuck up in an era where there was no computer or internet.

You need to search your name from a handwritten list of guests.

There is no form to fill up, on the back of a blank paper you need to write your name and mobile number! That’s all. 

Very quick indeed.

Reach your room and your door key would fail to cooperate. 

You feel like yelling ‘Khul ja Sim sim”.

If you are fortunate the housekeeping staff will come to you and after testing your communication skill in all possible languages you know she will understand and open your room with the master key she had.

You are grateful, but don’t have the courage or energy to ask how to do the door opening magic with the keycard provided to you.

The room air conditioner operates only in one setting and if you want to change the setting it would simply stop.

The TV remote was devoid of the battery, but who cares. 

You reach the washroom and were greeted with rusty mirror, stained curtains and leaking roof!!!

Take a bath by somehow managing the prehistoric shower fittings and then you realise there is hair dryer in the room... or in the entire hotel...yes that’s the reply you would get by pressing 4, the  housekeeping!

Even if you do not spend much time in the room still you will have enough opportunity to face their wonderful level of efficiency!

As I did.

Next day, I entered the restaurant at the lobby level for breakfast.

The lady at the entry point was busy with two other unhappy guests still I managed to utter my room number 511.

Before I could taste the cereals, the lady came to me and asked my room number again. 
I again replied.

In another 5 minutes when I was trying to munch something a man came to me and again asked for my room number.

I told him politely that the same question I have replied already before a couple of times, but still for your record, it is 511.

He went back.

After some 10 minutes when I finally managed to make the egg counter guy understand that I just want an omelette without chilli and tomato, that man again came to me and told as per there record they don’t have any guest in 511!!!

I didn’t know how to react!

It’s almost an existential question.

I have checked in 20 hours back, had my lunch and dinner and attended the conference throughout the day and after that as per the hotel records there is NO ONE in 511.

I tried to hide my frustration and told him, well then I am that ‘ Mr. NO ONE’ who is occupying that room for last one day!

But, I have another name too.

That man never came back and while coming out of the restaurant I asked if I need to show my Aadhar and PAN to prove that I am indeed ‘Mr. NO ONE’

Check out was easy.

I just had to tell them that I am ‘Mr. NO ONE from room number 511’.

I booked 2 rooms at the hotel via agoda (never book from this website). It all started with non cooperative staffs who started picking on pointless arguments boasting of her (name not mentioning) previous experiences of working in Taj Krishna and such. The rooms allotted were unclean and stinging. The shower tap was rusted and broke off. The jet spray was removed. All the bathroom accessories were dirty, towels and the tub marked with stains. The wifi that was promised at the time of booking, we found that is non existent. The only sensible person we found at the hotel was the bell boy who is a senior person, Helping the guests what ever way he can.
The hotel manager and his team is nothing but pathetic.

Bathroom are old and we had some plumbing problems every second day. Overall good value for money at this rate.

"Good food, needs renovation","3","2018-11","2018-11-26","A hotel I would recommend for budget conscious travellers who are not staying for too long and business travellers on short visits. The food is definitely worth writing about. But the rooms need a major refurbishment. I consider bathrooms as the standard by which hotels should be measured and unfortunately, this hotel did not really make the cut. The showers were terrifyingly rusty/ choked with mineral deposit, making them unworkable and I was forced to resort to the more healthy option of using the good old bucket and mug. I wasn't very encouraged to try out the pool. The wi-fi isn't the best. However, the hotel is located slap bang in the middle of a residential locality and you can find some of the better shopping facilities nearby. If you are a medical tourist, there are some good hospitals nearby.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r635926172-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452389859","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","1200","2","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mufasapartyanimal","Travelhappylawyer","9CD8FEB74016C944BD19D60C09532614",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","mufasapartyanimal",,"General Manager","643954750","en","2019-01-06","KATRIYA H","Dear Guest,

Had a few hours sleep, cold shower as no hot water and battled buffet breakfast....or what was left of it at 9am.  Had to ask 3 times for coffee, 2 tried to order eggs but gave up, there was hardly anything left, even for cereal i had to battle to get the cold milk jug refilled. The toaster was not plugged in, and when tggey got it to work it only toasted 1 side, there was empty containers strewn everywhere and we were given dirty knives and they would not clear any dishes, we gave up. We finally got internet downstsirs and immediately booked another hotel. We could not get into room as card would not work, housemaids would not let us in as our card had different room number. I went downstairs and explained the problem, repeating 5 times room number and said i just wanted to pack bags and leave, a see taff member finally made a new card and then disappeared into back office, he left me standing there and by this time i was furious.  My hubby was wsuting outside the roim and he came up with new card but the door would not open, in the meantime i was given a new card which did work (all this took over 30 minutes) and we packed and checked out. Staff were very unhelpful from check in to check out, corridors filthy and plaster eroding, everything is dusty and dirty which triggered an asthma attack, both rooms booked were disgusting, the others would not even shower there.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d583459-r633147014-Katriya_Hotel_Towers-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","92","87","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karingal72","karingal72","2AB87571E29ED332498D77D40F6DAF55",,"1210687","Kata Beach, Thailand","Kata Beach","karingal72",,"General Manager","634751984","en","2018-11-20","KATRIYA H","Dear Guest,

"6 Night stay in Jan 2024 - Great Hotel","5","2024-01","2024-02-14","I stayed at the Marriott Hotel in Hyderabad for 6 nights as I was visiting family/friends.   This is a great hotel and pretty good value.  The rooms were clean, well appointed and fully fitted out the requisite amenities.   Main restaurant has a very nice breakfast/lunch/dinner buffet.   The service throughout the hotel is excellent particularly in the restaurant.  I would like to give a special thanks & recognition to Swati who was so very engaged with myself and other guests.  A person that really seems to like her job.  

The only slight point I would make is that their Executive lounge is a rather odd configuration geometrically which doesn't make it very comfortable to linger.  Although the food served in very good.  

Will defintely stay here again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r938292424-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","68","32","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calgarytraveller100","International Traveler","1927ACB65E71CFCAC5D7944EFC9C620C",,,,,"calgarytraveller100",,"General Manager","1038458377","en","2025-11-10","Amardeep Singh","Dear TripAdvisor Member,

"Room for handicapped is totally unsafe and dangerous","1","2024-02","2024-02-13","My parents who are 85 years old and one of them is handicapped was given special room  2016 for handicapped . Unfortunately this room is nothing different from other regular rooms except few hand holding railing in bathroom in  toilet . The most important thing is the flooring , can’t believe toilet has granite flooring which totally unfit and completely unsafe , instead of haven’t anti slippery flooring and and anti slippery mats. The bedroom floor is made of wooden floor which becomes slippery for old people . The bed was too high and mattress is too soft and sinks in too deep where old people cat get up. There nothing special designed for old people and handicapped , sorry to say my mother had a fall unfortunately, as the floor slipped while getting out of the high bed ( old people standard). Only one hazard push button is provided .This the most dangerous room for handicapped old people , please do not allot this room.
The good thing the staff are very courteous and service was good. 
Once agin this room is dangerous and luckily nothing major happened to my mother . 
It is painful to write like this review but it might help

"Very comfortable modern hotel with excellent staff","4","2024-01","2024-01-30","It is large modern hotel in a good part of the city to stay. Spotlessly clean, and the staff could not be more helpful. Room comfortable with very good bed. Only complaint was the shower. I have moaned in other reviews about the lack of thermostatic shower taps, and this is why.

"Great Hospitality Pretty Good Environment Clean Place ","5","2023-12","2024-01-07","A pretty good Spa unlike several others that claim to be the best Spa in Hyderabad

The hosts are welcoming and start by taking your booking details. Next, you fill out some details of what you’d like for your massage, the pressure, which oil you’d like to use to cater to your needs.

We opted for a one hour couple massage which was reasonably priced ,The place is clean, considering it’s inside the Marriott’s, spacious enough as well and offers a mid segment premium feel.

The therapists Soso and (I forgot the other therapist’s name) were well trained and knew pressure points and could identify any knots in your body and worked on them. They were in communication every now and then to gauge if the pressure was adequate.

Indian Herbal Tea was offered both as we got in and after we were done. I recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing day, although, I would recommend that you take the 90 minute session because the 60 minute feels so good that you’ll need more time.
Overall a superb experience will surely visit again ","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r932754040-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"381","724293471","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/2b/d7/5f/donna-m.jpg","381","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnamG1445YS","Donna M","360C2041C793ADDC3799EF1CCA01D43B",,"60795","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Philadelphia","donnamG1445YS",,"General Manager","1038459353","en","2025-11-10","Amardeep Singh","Dear TripAdvisor Member,

"One of the best hotels in Secunderabad","4","2023-11","2023-12-26","The hotel is located in Secunderabad, very close to the Hussain Sagar Lake. It is an old hotel, but well maintained. The staff was very friendly and the service was excellent. The rooms were comfortable but I would suggest not to choose the rooms that have a view of the lake. The hotel claims these are superior rooms (because of the view), but neglects to mention that there is a sewage line running between the hotel and the lake. Which totally screws the view. I kept the blinds closed on both days I stayed there.

Breakfast was great - plenty of choice and very good service. The staff actually care about your welfare. Being a Platinum member, had access to the lounge, where they serve drinks and snacks in the evening. However, for some reason, they've changed the timings of the lounge access and it closes by 8.30. It was 9.30 pm earlier. I would request the hotel to change it back to 9.30.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r931060344-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","761832275","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/68/a3/53/caption.jpg","1200","215","2187","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajeshkk","Rajesh K K","0F26FC70929DB0BB608AA8C8212AC387",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","rajeshkk",,"General Manager","1038459689","en","2025-11-10","Amardeep Singh","Dear TripAdvisor member,

"Good place with nearby attractions","4","2024-12","2025-01-02","Good place with nearby attractions
We stayed there for 4 nights and picked this place due to proximity of all the major attractions. Some key pointers from the staying experience.
-	Good spacious rooms with helpful staffs
-	Good spread of buffet 
-	Ample parking spaces if you are travelling by own car
-	All the major attractions are in proximity (4-5 kms radius), such as Birla Mandir, Hussain Sagar, Salarjung, Nizam palace, Charminar
-	Auto and cabs are easily available
The only thing to keep in mind that the hotel is located at very busy road, taking car out and in might be little tricky some hour of day.

"Most Noisy Hotel","2","2024-11","2024-11-11","The three nights' stay at the hotel was a really unpleasant one. There was a large group of unruly and mischievous young college boys and girls  staying at the hotel. Every night, it appeared that all of them were high and would run around in the corridors, scream and yell and also ring other rooms' door bells till about 3am. Although i complained to the front desk, they were totally helpless. It appears that the hotel often gets lot of tourist bookings through travel sites and hence have high occupancy. People looking for peaceful nights would certainly want to avoid this hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d1152249-r979464695-Best_Western_Ashoka-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452387495","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","1200","16","35","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajkaral","Rajeevan K","572C1937C4766043B61DD340A3C3500F",,"297586","Hyderabad, India","Hyderabad","rajkaral",,"Owner","979583986","en","2024-11-12","ABDUL AZIZ","Dear Mr. Rajkaral

Special appreciation to Dinesh and Suresh. They both did a wonderful job to make sure that the event is a grand success .

One point I would like to say about the areas of improvement are the rooms, they need to be renovated a little bit

"Misnomer Marriott ","1","2023-11","2023-11-21","I have been at Various Marriott Properties-this one is an exception-absolutely fail to understand how the property got the Marriott Franchise.
The rooms, its size, upkeep, aesthetics leave much to be desired.
It is not a patch on Marriott not even a poor cousin.
Some Rich or Influential person somehow hoodwinked Marriott and got labelled as Marriott.
The TV is installed at probably 135 Degrees from the bed-and one can get a crooked neck if one watches TV from the bed.
The F & B is a different scenario-a chilli  chicken had  such small  crumbs which could not be picked up with a fork.
Staff at Breakfast was not aware they have a tea counter.
Agreed Marriott has various brands-probably this property may not fit to the lowest category Marriott.

"Average Stay, but needs improvement in maintenance","3","2018-07","2018-09-07","Greetings!
We stayed there for 3 nights for the Hyderabad visit.  The ambiance at the lounge and the restaurant was excellent. The reception office needs improvement in the service. My luggage was unattended and was not delivered at the room. I had to go myself to the reception and the get the luggage to the room.  The house keeping was excellent, but every night when we return back, the access card to the room will not work. We have to go downstairs at the reception to re-activate it. A 15 minutes job to re-activate and this process is very hectic, when we all are tired.  Also the corridor carpet to the room was stinky and smelly. The room interior is good, but not maintained properly ( broken toilet shower, partially closing toilet door etc). The restaurant breakfast was excellent and staff was very caring. But very afraid for the reviews of the rudeness of front office, but managed to make them cool for 2-3 incidents at the stay.  Overall satisfactory stay at Hyderabad.

"Mohammed Mubeenuddin","1","2018-07","2018-07-29","It was my mistake that I trusted ibibo cheap offer as mentioned 65% Discount but acctual price was lesser than I paid after discount so can't say cheated by ibibo portal or the katria hotel as currently hotel was going through renovation so there was too many issues right from to delay in check-in to noice of repairs work no water some time or no hot water supply till end. When I raise the issue with front office staff they requested me to call our booking agent ibibo so I did and ibibo support executive intervene lead us to another higher room but no response from house keeping or room service when ask for drinking water even I guess short of working staff finally I lost my day and made my weekend as a lesson. My sincere advice to all do not visit this hotel untill renewed completely.

"Amazing quality staff","4","2023-02","2023-07-30","This hotel has the best staff service I have ever experienced in a hotel.  When we received notice the night before that our train would not come to Hyderabad the concierge staff worked tirelessly talking with train service and then arranging a reliable driver instead, even giving the driver clear instructions that safety came first.  When staff overheard my wife casually mentioning that the pool has seen better days, hotel management profusely apologized  and sought to make amends, though we didn't even mention the issue to them.  When we left, they packed us lunches without charge.  This is a hotel with staff that are really really trying to please their customers.  

Hotel is well located for Secunderabad, and still a shortish taxi (20-30 min) to reach historic Hyderabad.  It overlooks the (unfortunately smelly) large lake, but one doesn't notice the smell inside of course.  Food was excellent.  We sought an American-style hotel in which not everything was filled with hot chilis, and the hotel delivered.  I would stay here again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r906712631-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452386713","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","1200","20","53","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DapperDiplomat","DapperDiplomat","FC212B5D71ABEECAA4409E072F954C31",,,,,"DapperDiplomat",,"General Manager","1038547069","en","2025-11-10","Amardeep Singh","Dear TripAdvisor member,

Thanks to the team for a surprise birthday celebration. Really thoughtful.
The food and service is excellent. In fact u loved the sambhar. Great breakfast spread. Very sumptuous and the overall service is so so good. I mean Marriot just lives upto its name. 
Special mention to Mr. Sauvik the manager. I had a small issue in my room which was immediately addressed. So not really too problematic. But the way Mr. Saumik responded to it was phenomenal. I mean from sending along excellent coffee for my travel to writing personally - it is service at its best.
In a hotel which receives tons of guests this type of a service just makes you feel so special and welcome. 
Also if visiting do chat with Mr. Vohra, the very warm and dynamic guest relations head. Such a pleasure chatting with him.
Loved every bit of it and looking forward to staying again very soon. Keep up the great work.

"Wonderful Care at Courtyard Marriott & Marriott Convention","5","2023-05","2023-07-12","It was our 13th Marriage Anniversary and we decided to club our work and holidays at Hyderabad. Must say great reception and care throughout was accorded by the Hotel Manager Mr. Ashwin Vaidya. It was our early checkin and our arrival tracked. Special Thanks to Madam Sanika Pradhan for her help and guidance. We were felicitated with a traditional welcome with tikka and a shawl on our shoulders. Our Rooms decorated with also towel art and balloons in the room. The Rooms were at its best with welcome amenities and delicious designed chocolates. Despite being a Gold Member, I was offered their Lounge facility. A big shout out and special thanks to Mr. Rugved Dacha, Loyalty Manager, Mr. Saumik Sur, Rooms Division Manager, Housekeeping Manager Mr. Jitendra Yadav and Mr. Pankaj Singh from Housekeeping. Their service was marvellous ensuring us all the possible care needed. Special Thanks also to Mr. Akshat Selat for ensuring smooth transition from Courtyard Room to Marriott Room internally. 
We also had great food hospitality from Gaurav Mahadeshwar and Tanay Kala. The food was exceptionally great and enjoying at Okra & Bidri. Tremendous and personal support received from Gaurav and Tanay. Both of them were simply fabulous in their treatment towards us. We were delighted to be offered fresh juice and special dosa and paratha were made for us. We are indeed very grateful to both of them for this hospitality. Appreciate Himanshu F&B from Marriott too.
Appreciate the leadership and congratulate Mr. Ashwin for having such a wonderful, fabulous, effective team that are on its toes to ensure their guest comfortable. 
In one single word Amazing Experience and really thank you for making our Anniversary so very special.
I look forward recommending to my friends in Hyderabad to conduct events in this Hotel.

Thank you for your feedback and for reviewing us on TripAdvisor.

We truly apologize once again for the missing onions with the food order and for the degree of doneness of the roasted papad. We realize it must have been frustrating for you and offer our sincere regrets again.

We do wish to request you again to not use abusive language with the hotel team members, especially the ladies. Our lady colleague merely tried to convey that. 

As a team, we’ve taken your feedback on board and promise to make amends to our processes.

We wish you a pleasant day.

A special mention to Rigved, Dinesh, Sania, Prakash and Kaleem whom we frequently interacted with, and who made us feel so special and at home.
The attention paid by the hotel to even the most minute things to make us feel royal is highly appreciated.

"Mediocre experience and terrible breakfasts","1","2023-03","2023-03-06","After having stayed at most prominent properties in the city, finally narrowed down upon Courtyard Hyderabad and Marriott Hyderabad for a split stay during my 12 day long work trip to Hyderabad, of which the first 7 was at courtyard and the next 5 at Marriott. 

The stay at Marriott Hyderabad & convention centre was overall quite mediocre. 

Common area & Rooms
The hotel overall felt quite old and very cramped. The room was exactly the same, specially with the twin beds choice we had opted for. There were parts of the hotel which had a stench, not something you expect at the price point. 

We got a swimming pool view room, thanks to which I avoided visiting the pool. The pool was among the least inviting ones I have seen across hotel chains in Hyderabad. 

Food / breakfasts
While they have a lavish breakfast spread, almost everything was inedible on all occasions. While I could explain this in painful details, here are some highlights:
- sabudhana khichdi which extremely oily
- Aloo parata where the first half I had tasted fab, but ended up being undercooked on every occasion after
- Dosas which lacked the sourness
- The day I found dhoklas and was excited about the new alternative, it just withered away at the the touch of the fork. Tasting mediocre was a separate problem. 

By day 4 and 5 of our stay here, we had moved to finding alternates:
Filter coffee (which was fab) became a meal replacement. 
Fruit counters had long wait times and there is no surprises why

On the other hand, bidri dining experience was fabulous (reviewing it separately). The baking company and room service for dinner was quite good too. 

Service
The staff were largely courteous and special mentions to the gentleman who was a repeat feature during our room service orders and the young lady who attended to us at Bidri. But what put me off was that they refused to accept tips if added to bill or room. Pay in cash or not seemed to be the hotel-wide policy. 

Pricing
The property is priced comparably to the Taj’s and ITC’s of similar vintage. But not necessarily offering a similar experience. Since I took a club Marriott membership, I had some discounts which forced me to continue with the booking. 

Overall, one property that is surely going into my negative list and I would highly recommend its twin, the courtyard Marriott over this.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r881238064-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,,,,,"63","405","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajit_induchudan","ajit_induchudan","FB905D43B3FA096989C538F5DD77CAB2",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","ajit_induchudan",,"Marketing","881551439","en","2023-03-09","akanksha chatterjee","Dear Guest,

The front office staff is excellent, Yash and his colleagues were very courteous and hospitable. Guest service managers like Rugved make you are at home.
The living spaces are excellent, the pools are well maintained, and 3-layer security is noted. Personal trainers in Gymnasium are good and Gym is very clean. 
The lounge on the top floor is a great place to entertain your local guests in the evening, has a full lake view from the top
The exterior needs a fresh coat of paint. Exterior needs regular maintenance of this landmark and historical building.
Strongly recommend this place, there are lots of old and reliable shopping areas less than a KM from the hotel, MG Circle, General Bazar, and Monda Market areas.
Avoid the traffic mess of Hitec city, Madhapur, etc, save hours and hours relaxing instead of sitting in your standstill cars inhaling toxic automobile smoke in this very busy city.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d620076-r881197664-Hyderabad_Marriott_Hotel_Convention_Centre-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"50","119865110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/ff/16/rathna-kumar-y.jpg","50","63","76","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rathnakumary","RATHNA KUMAR Y","48B2DD83FC3C76CBF60221EBE83B6FF4",,"36888","Willowbrook, Illinois","Willowbrook","rathnakumary",,"Marketing","881550931","en","2023-03-09","akanksha chatterjee","Dear Guest,

"Super Stay and Value for Money","5","2024-04","2024-04-18","I and my sister visit last week for our hyderabad trip and stayed for 5 days, the rooms and service is good. The best was the supportive and caring staff, they guided and helped us . The breakfast is also nice. The plus point of this hotel is its location, near to metro station and all the tourist locations are nearby which will make it easy for you to reach any location in max 20 to 25 mins. I would surely recommend this hotel.👍

Rooms
Rooms are good and provide standard amenities like towel, soap,shampoo,water bottles everyday

Nearby activities
Hussain sagar lake, birla temple, secretariat building, Ntr gardens,ujjaini mahakali temple all are jus 10-15mins away. Rajthali is an rajasthani veg food (himayat nagar) awesome thali and food. Presently there is mango season going on. Airport is just 35 to 40 mins away. Salar jung museum, chowmahalla place n charminar also max 25 mins you can reach. Best is Ramoji film city transportation pick up location ( central court hotel) is next to this hotel so in case u r visiting ramoji film city which one time must visit, its transportation bus will pick from this hotel.

Safety
Its is very safe for family or solo ladies or group of ladies.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297586-d1152249-r947378933-Best_Western_Ashoka-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",,"1200","452387495","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bhavna315","Bhavna315","92C3C2C9DE3C054756530A737F2AB541",,,,,"Bhavna315",,"Guest Services / Front Office","947794585","en","2024-04-21","ABDUL AZIZ","Dear Guest,

Breakfast taste was basic, staff very uncourteous, menu very limited, swimming pool is not available,
Need to call lot of times for basic requirements like hand towel, shower cap, etc....
Wifi strength is very poor.
We had paid 5k in advance for booking but at the time of check in, the front office staff made us pay full amount bill. So unfortunately we didn't have option to change the hotel the next day.
