"Pathetic Experience!","1","2025-04","2025-04-21","Pathetic Experience!

Stains on wall, used and torn towel in bathroom, condition of towel was as if it is used for cleaning purpose, shabby bucket and mug, no toiletries or dental kit provided, no slippers, switch boards not working, unstitched and torn quilt cover,
Staff not behaved properly!
Anything asked to provide to person sitting at reception, his reply always came “you should have told us” , even for simple dental kits and slippers!!

Why you have kept bed also….that should have also been provided when asked by guests!!!

Free breakfast which was offered was plain parantha, curd (bad quality), pohe (bad taste) and achaar
If asked for chatni, their reply was ""eat with aachaar only""

Come’on man…there is basic etiquette of replying to guests which is badly lacking  at your place!!!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144763-r1003727041-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452387495","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chittranjans2018","Chittranjan B","5060378C68ED07F8F5A563E19C67BF13",,,,,"chittranjans2018",,"Owner","1004069872","en","2025-04-24","Treebo Hotels","Dear Chittranjan, Thank you for your review.

Hotel lifts also take you up to the Mall Road which makes it very easy to enjoy Mall Road and you can make multiple trips if you like.
Didn’t like the breakfast spread though. While the staff was quite supportive, options were limited for a hotel of such status and which boasts of classy brewhouse and restaurant/cafe.

"Excellent location, but efficiency of staff was a big drawback.","3","2024-10","2024-10-22","there are various aspects to review in this hotel. 
firstly, upon entering the property no parking facility was present. travellers who usually move around Himachal Pradesh, travel by cars and not having a parking facility is a huge problem. 
check-in was very casual. no documents or identification proofs were asked upon checking up which can be a huge safety concern. 
while transporting our luggage from the reception to the rooms, the journey is via a huge long ramp, and the luggage wheels get damaged in the process. also the staff were banging the suitcases left right and centre and no care was given to the luggages. 
there are 3 lifts inside the property and it is quite complicated for guests to move around the property. 
the rooms were good enough for 2 persons and the washroom was a little old fashioned with no jet-spray next to the washroom area. 
towels were dirty and yellow in colour. 
location of the property is excellent since you can reach Mall Road from inside the property. 
the hotel had 3 cafes and extensive menu. shisha is also available in the hotel cafe. 
breakfast had limited options, but quality and taste of the food was good. 
staff was friendly but not very efficient 
in room dining facility was good and we got all we needed.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r975022317-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452389859","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","1200","2","21","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABiswas007","A Biswas","4FEA59461DC38B25629F2656CFF08248",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","ABiswas007",,,,,,,,"The Mall, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"The Mall",,"588617","31.102173","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17724","Hotel Combermere Shimla","549","3.8","43","28","67","257","154","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d588617-Reviews-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://www.hotelcombermere.com/"

The hotel is a good business hotel, the rooms are spacious. The gym is quite small but has what you need. I didn't try room service because the Mall Road restaurants are so near!

It's summer now so I guess room heaters are not working, only air conditioning. But it can get cold in the evening, if you are cold, just turn off the air conditioning and the room will warm up eventually.

"Exceptional Hospitality with a Heartwarming Local Touch","5","2025-04","2025-04-29","My stay at Radisson Jass Shimla, though just for one night, was an experience I’ll always cherish. From the moment I arrived, I was met with genuine warmth and kindness. The entire staff, especially at the front desk, were extremely courteous and down-to-earth. It was heartening to know that most of them are local Pahadis—people native to Shimla—who bring a special charm and humility to their service.

After two sleepless nights traveling from Bangalore, carrying my 8-year-old due to limited connectivity, I was exhausted. Mr. Rakesh at the front desk went out of his way to arrange an early check-in, ensuring my daughter and I could rest. That thoughtful gesture made all the difference and showed true hospitality.

The breakfast spread was generous, and the in-room dining service was both fast and delicious. The hotel also provides a free shuttle to nearby attractions, which added great convenience to our short stay.

Everything about the experience—from the service to the people—was simply perfect. Radisson Jass Shimla is a shining example of hospitality done right. I truly hope they continue this level of service. People will not only love the hotel but also the warm-hearted Pahadi spirit behind it.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r1005172656-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452389359","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nalinir328","Nalini R","40B19D76B51FC937233194F9C4F90B0F",,,,,"nalinir328",,"Guest Services / Front Office","1005621385","en","2025-05-03","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest, We appreciate you taking the time to review us.

"Unsafe, Worst and Unprofessional experience","1","2025-04","2025-04-29","We were 5 girls who booked 2 rooms here. In the evening, the neighboring room had extremely loud guests (including some foreigners). Despite complaining again and again, the reception falsely claimed the room was unoccupied and there might be staff in the room.
Later at night, one intoxicated guest from the neighbouring room started banging on our door and shouting. We were terrified and had to call security as he might have had weapons. The man started returning to his room on seeing the security guard. The man had alcohol crates and might be drugs too in his room and was shifted somewhere else late at night.
Shockingly, the next morning the manager, Rahul Rana, instead of apologizing, accused us of causing trouble to that guest and refused to show CCTV footage or refunding the amount for stay. We were not able to sleep whole night. 
This was the worst hotel experience ever — no safety, no professionalism. Not recommended, especially for women travellers.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r1005091343-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452361217","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silkagupta","Dr Silka","D69E5BB513BF64F10B0B0E0C7F103070",,,,,"Silkagupta",,"Guest Services / Front Office","1005615521","en","2025-05-03","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest,

Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding your recent stay. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and distress caused during your visit.

I personally met with you on the night of the incident to address the matter and immediately arranged for a security guard to be stationed on your floor to ensure your safety and comfort.

Earlier that evening, our team had offered you a room change, which was declined at the time. Following the situation, I also spoke with the guest from the neighboring room—a senior citizen—who explained that he had knocked on your door at approximately 23:10 hours to request a reduction in volume from your room, as he was unable to sleep. Nonetheless, considering the circumstances, we relocated him to another room later that night to prevent further disturbance.

We thoroughly reviewed the CCTV footage and found no evidence of any physical threat or aggressive behavior. As a gesture of goodwill and to acknowledge the disruption, we waived the additional charge for a third person staying in your room.

 Our team made every effort to manage the situation promptly and professionally. We take guest safety and satisfaction very seriously and are committed to continually improving our processes to prevent such occurrences in the future.

However, bearing in mind most people have had a very long journey to get to Shimla, our welcome was spoiled by the sheer speed of talking and the amount of information being given to us. We just could not take it all in. No one has clearly sat down and tried to understand how much info is being given to new guests and how it is delivered- it was hopeless. 
The hotel is set on 3 levels, in 3 separate buildings, with walkways and lots of lifts but other than using an outside stair lift we could not get to the restaurant. The restaurant food was very good, and the staff very friendly but it took ages to get a black tea or coffee - if you weren't having Masala tea, you just sat and waited and waited.
I'd go again for the views and window seat, but not for the accessibilty of the hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r1002388254-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452388731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","1","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenmC8640JH","Karen M","D9EB4399A1E546707617B1E42FF190C2",,"186403","Coventry, United Kingdom","Coventry","karenmC8640JH",,"Guest Services / Front Office","1005621572","en","2025-05-03","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest, We apologize for the inconvenience caused and have taken the corrective measure to ensure our guest gets the best of experience.

"Disappointing Service at Radisson Jazz Shimla","1","2025-03","2025-03-11","I just moved to Radisson Jazz Shimla after a great stay at Radisson Kufri, and honestly, it’s been disappointing.

Check-in was slow, though Aditya at the front desk was helpful. I asked about an paid upgrade and saw the junior suite, still deciding on it. But my real issue is with the service.

First, I ordered boneless biryani, but they sent one with bones. They replaced it, but why mess up a simple order? Then, my thukpa arrived with spillage and a hair. Didn’t take a pic of that (because, ew), but I did catch one on the salt shaker. Basic hygiene should not be an issue at a Radisson.

Housekeeping was another letdown. I called 3 times to get my plates cleared after dinner—nothing. They finally picked them up the next morning, so my room smelled like food all night.

Also, I couldn’t help but notice that foreign guests seem to get extra attention. I get the whole international hospitality thing, but Indian guests are paying the same and deserve the same service. If the hotel is understaffed, they need to manage it better.

The bathroom also needs work—tiles look like they need scrubbing, and parts of the wall are peeling. Didn’t expect this from a Radisson property.

I still have two more nights here and hope things improve. Planning to check out the spa too—fingers crossed that goes well. Sharing this so the hotel (hopefully) takes note and improves for future guests.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r997680693-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452389949","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg","1200","6","126","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onlypawsitive_vibe","Tanvi Behere","B30480BC54BE0505A647F432206834F7",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","onlypawsitive_vibe",,"Guest Services / Front Office","999322644","en","2025-03-23","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest, We apologize for the inconvenience caused and have taken the corrective measure to ensure our guest gets the best of experience.

"Beautiful views and some nice dining","4","2025-02","2025-02-23","We stayed a couple of nights. Check in was slow, but eventually we arrived at our room which was located just off the main lobby. We had to get help to show us to the bar and restaurant as it was a confusing layout of different levels and directions. As the hotel is on the hillside this was to be expected but what we didn’t expect was the temperature inside the bar which was very cold with only one mobile heater. It made having a pre dinner drink really challenging. Knowing this, the second night we wore coats and we had the heater next to us, but still cold. Our room had some lovely views and there was reasonable storage as well as seating and table. The bathroom had a shower only and needed some repairs to the door as it wouldn’t shut. No dressing gown and mini bar not stocked. The two dinners we had, we chose a la carte and the food and service was very good. Breakfast had basic buffet selection but an efficient egg station.  Vikrant  was very attentive and friendly and we enjoyed his service. The staff however at Reception were a bit confused and disorganised. There is a Spa but no fitness or gym facilities.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r995206807-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452387402","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg","1200","330","723","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jmahg","Jmahg","9B2F18A26D1189E789C92DFB17D19AFD",,"186418","Maidenhead, United Kingdom","Maidenhead","Jmahg",,"Guest Services / Front Office","999322674","en","2025-03-23","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest, We apologize for the inconvenience caused and have taken the corrective measure to ensure our guest gets the best of experience.

The location is just at walking distance to the main mall road. Staff was wonderful and Tamanna from front office was really nice and helpful. My whole family admired her. The breakfast options were limited but great. The only disappointment was the breakfast items from the buffet during closing were not allowed takeaway for journey like they allow in other hotels, and we were told by the manager that we can't do it there.

"My 4th Shimla vacay !","4","2025-02","2025-02-15","Having previously stayed at the stunning Oberoi Cecil in Shimla, my expectations for the Radisson were quite high. Unfortunately, my experience was somewhat mixed.

Firstly, the location is a bit of a letdown. While the hotel is situated just behind the Mall Road, I have certainly stayed at more convenient spots. The uphill walk to reach the road can be quite challenging, especially after a long day of exploring. However, the hotel does provide a complimentary pick-up and drop service to the nearest point on the Mall Road, which is a nice touch.

On a positive note, the staff at the Radisson were incredibly friendly and welcoming. Tamanna at the reception was particularly helpful, and our check-in process was seamless. The hotel's layout can be a bit confusing due to its sloped design, but there are elevators available on multiple levels, which made getting around easier.

When it comes to dining, I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The food at the in-house restaurant and through room service was fabulous, with a great variety of dishes to choose from. Tanisha and Tejeshwar in the restaurant were attentive and made our dining experience even more enjoyable. A special mention goes to Niranjan, who helped organize a private bonfire dinner for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary, though this did come at an additional cost.

Overall, while I would recommend the Radisson Shimla for its excellent service and food, it may not be my first choice for accommodation in Shimla, especially when compared to the exceptional experience I had at the Oberoi Cecil.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r994116834-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1280","127339220","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/97/0a/d4/mangsy.jpg","847","61","191","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mangsy","Mangsy","5ECEAD123CA50B8AC23B57250119C511",,"297604","Goa, India","Goa","Mangsy",,"Guest Services / Front Office","999322041","en","2025-03-23","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest, We appreciate you taking the time to review us.

Though the whole staff was pretty nice, there was this person named Saurabh Bhatt at the bar managing all the people standing there with such ease and smile and co-operating everyone. He has really good communication skills that even when he was denying someone of any particular drink that was not available he was still at ease and gave them the options they could try instead.

"Good hotel but bad service","3","2022-08","2022-08-26","The rooms are beautiful with good valley view. Location is also good and there is good free parking available.
I am giving 3/5 for the following negatives:
- Security - the hotel is next to the main road but there’s no scanning of luggage, checking of individuals or any temperature check
- Staff - very laid back attitude. As per hotel policy, all standard facilities are there - drinking water, shampoo/body wash, slippers, etc but we needed to ask for everything and then got it
- restaurant - very very slow. Waiters take orders and then forget. Two days there was no buffet breakfast and we were the only ones for the breakfast - yet we received a basic order like paratha and omelette after 3 reminders and more than 30 mins. After first day, every day we had to remind them to give papad or onion.

"Delightful experience, great hospitality!!","5","2022-06","2022-06-14","Post a 2-year hiatus from travel, we zeroed in on Shimla on a whim, mainly driven by the local Summer Festival. We decided on Marina without much planning, key factor being easy access to the Mall where the fest was to be. Looking back, I can gladly say that choosing Marina was the best decision we made. Superior Room was spacious and the desk & Wi-fi provided us a comfortable space for urgent office work. Courtesy & pleasant behavior of the entire staff from front desk to kitchen & housekeeping was refreshing. Though busy, the staff always made sure of including the personal touch in all our interactions. Room-service & Housekeeping was efficient. Regarding food, be it the buffet breakfast or Room service, the food was fresh & tasty. Breakfast at the roof top was a pleasure and a big shout out to chefs in the Open kitchen & all the servers who served us with big smiles on their faces. Kudos to the DJ as well, who relentlessly played the best tunes (requests even) to jumpstart our days. Property itself is spacious and tastefully done with a well-equipped gym, playroom, and spa. The restaurant & bar are elegant and beautifully done. A big shout out to Mercy from the spa who took great care of us. As we had to check out quite early in the morning, the kitchen was kind enough to pack sandwiches & cupcakes for us. 
All in all, its a great place to be if you are in Shimla. My heartfelt thanks & best wishes to the Team at Marina, keep up the great work you are doing!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d3418119-r842850214-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,,,,,"3","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bohemianChi","bohemianChi","A228B26CABE5225310DD9B7ABDCC5B0E",,"1532344","Navi Mumbai, India","Navi Mumbai","bohemianChi",,,,,,,,"Mall Road near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Mall Road","near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate","3418119","31.09695","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17689","Hotel Marina","411","4.2","17","17","39","143","195","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d3418119-Reviews-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://marinashimla.com"

The highlight of the hotel is its food and location. The food is very delicious specially there pizzas and shahi tukda. The service is also very prompt.

i stayed here with my family and the services from the hotel were up to the mark, the view from rooms are just awestruck. room no 302 has best view and i was lucky to see live snowfall from the hotel room.
the staff behaviour is very polite. mr vijay and mr rahul are very helpful they helped us in getting our car out from snow.

"Rich Hillstation unwelcomed guests","2","2021-01","2021-01-11","We came from. Long drive from delhi with kids. As we reached and checked-in everything was fine. But sooner we realise with small small things the staff was sooooo fussy. They had a permanent NO to any thing we ask them, like about mall road, about masks, about food, restaurant..N so on. 

Wot u expect is when u go to a new place and that too after a year long break from covid pandemic and lockdown, a little warm welcome.
A little bit of care. But I feel shimla is a rich hillstation now and don't care for its tourists anymore.

No doubt food was amazing. But was served cold in our rooms coz we were not allowed to enter restaurant as they said it's closed but they closed light in front of our eyes to show us. We noticed .

Rooms are amazing .Very comfortable and cozy. View is very nice. A lot done by MR. Thakur to make this property ,ur hard work is well acknowledged and praised ., But keep an eye on ur staff. I don't wanna name anyone here .

Their personal parking is so down  the hotel we have to go down the hill and climbing back is a big pain. Surprisingly they had a lift which is also operational but the door after the lift was closed and not open for any one.,with god knows their personal reasons.

"Central Travelodge Dundee","2","2020-10","2020-10-21","Unfortunately this hotel was not a good place for me to stay over, for my business trip to Scotland. The hotel noise at night got louder with a strange droning noise above. Sounded like loud music but I think it was some kind of machinery. The hotel is not ideal for business trips as no business floor and on a city centre busy road.  The public with families noise was unbearable last night. Maybe I was unlucky who knows with the people staying same night near me.

"Average for a high Priced Hotel","3","2019-11","2020-09-26","The hotel is located at one end of the Mall road (or should I say just before it begins).

Pros
- Location makes it a bit of an advantage for those wanting to roam around.
- Parking is ample.
- Friendly staff
- Good rooms

Cons
- Garden View Room is actually an artificially made room with artificial grass on the walls and with a table or two with chairs.
- Average breakfast
- Ambience of a 3 star hotel in a 4 star hotel.
- Generator smell near the rooms with the valley view. There is a generator that operates 24x7 and the smell causing a headache.
- Not worth the price paid

All in all, an average experience.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d3418119-r772055652-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","53","107","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdsinghrc","Sdsingh","F617558F90DA0885EAFE91790BCE4809",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","sdsinghrc",,,,,,,,"Mall Road near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Mall Road","near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate","3418119","31.09695","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17689","Hotel Marina","411","4.2","17","17","39","143","195","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d3418119-Reviews-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://marinashimla.com"
"Short notice booking - no regrets plus great location","4","2020-03","2020-03-22","Booked this hotel for 2 nights after 1 night in a hotel with no heating that was freezing.  Location was excellent just off the pedestrianised Mall, the rooms were warm (central heating), modern and spotlessly clean.  If you are visiting Shimla when the weather can be changeable plus cold having a warm room to come back to where you can dry off and prepare to go back out agin is a must.  Note that a lot of hotels do not offer central heating only electric fires which are not adequate when the temperature drops below freezing and there is snow on the ground.   Beware the Heritage tag which is applied to a lot of hotels.  Highly recommend the Marina for any stay in Shimla.  Note that the hotel seems to not be offered by European tour operators which is pity.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d3418119-r751603572-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"859","518123154","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1e/e1/ee/92/paulr685.jpg","859","88","247","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulr685","Paul R","90003C9F9AB1AF3E030642AF01B66B30",,"1069784","Royston, United Kingdom","Royston","paulr685",,,,,,,,"Mall Road near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Mall Road","near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate","3418119","31.09695","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17689","Hotel Marina","411","4.2","17","17","39","143","195","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d3418119-Reviews-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://marinashimla.com"
"MARINA Is Really Good","5","2020-02","2020-03-18","3 nights 3 rooms in Feb 2nd week on recommendation of one in the group who stayed here before and encouraged by positive reviews at TripAdvisor. had booked  valley facing  superior rooms but to our pleasant surprised were  upgraded to Executive Rooms. OUR IMPRESSIONS: Arrived in own cars after negotiating a short but quite  steep stretch of road , not unusual for a hill property. on arrival parking assistants immediately took charge of the cars ,unloaded and consigned the cars to basement parking (hotel has parking space adjacent to the property at road level also). RECEPTION/CHECK IN: Although at road level but actually 3rd floor of the hotel .Very polite and welcoming , check in smooth and fast. Lobby area quite large for a hotel of this size. LOCATION: Just perfect. Last private property on that part of the road. Starting point of Mall Road from hotel side. Ridge just 8-10 minutes leisurely walk on the Mall.This seems strongest part of Marina. ROOMS: Our executive rooms at the lobby level(3rd floor) were absolute delight. Very large with balcony. Over looking the beautiful valley and mountains beyond - great view.. Very comfortable bed. sofa executive desk. Room lighting very good. Electrical sockets conveniently spread all over. Understated ambiance . Clean, very well maintained. Bath rooms spic & span with shower enclosure. Good quality toilet essentials, bath towels.Super central AC/Heating . Rooms offer a very relaxing and peaceful stay. FOOD/BUFFET: Massive dining area at the zero level with a panoramic  view of the valley again a pleasant surprise. Buffet brekfast well laid out. However almost same veg fare everyday and non veg fare quite inadequate. Food and beverage quality good. The best part here is superlative service. Tea coffee or any eats ordered from the table served in a jiffy by very attentive and polite staff. Food served in the rooms also excellent. TRAVEL DESK: Although had own cars but preferred a hired one due snow laden tricky roads. Provided a brand new Crysta . Driver quite experienced and knowledgeable which made our trip to snow laden new Kufri and other areas very enjoyable.  Summary: Very pleasant experience overall. Facilities and amenities offered by Marina are first class-best in class in Shimla perhaps. Strongly recommended. Would appear to be a little over priced though but worth it frankly.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d3418119-r751294746-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452389859","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","1200","19","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/subodhj2017","subodhj2017","B338D93EDD7EA06C14CF88F1E5137F3B",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","subodhj2017",,,,,,,,"Mall Road near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Mall Road","near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate","3418119","31.09695","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17689","Hotel Marina","411","4.2","17","17","39","143","195","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d3418119-Reviews-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://marinashimla.com"

"Excellent location for visiting Shimla with friends","4","2019-10","2019-12-02","Approach to this hotel is along a steep small single track road by car.  The hotel has a car park which is located next to it however the road directly after that is prohibited so it is not possible to drive any further.  Initial impression of the hotel decor upon arrival was good, we were greeted with a cold drink, although check in was slow.  The rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated with nice views across the valley.  A little disappointed to find there was no iron in the room which was made available by request.  For a hotel of this quality there were no slippers in the rooms.  We were a group of friends who wanted a place to meet, have a drink and a chat in the evening before dinner and found the bar to be very dark and dated with a constant loop of music videos.  Service in the bar however was fine.
We went to the restaurant and were seated by 9 pm, no one came to take our order, eventually we managed to attract someone's attention.  After placing our order the food arrived after 10.20 pm.  The food was good but by then hunger had ruined the evening.  Needless to say that the service in the restaurant was abysmal with no visible sign of any management.  Breakfast the following morning was satisfactory.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d3418119-r730187328-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","75","95","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UKtripper100","UKtripper100","A58CA454910B36DF558AEE649E567AE3",,,,,"UKtripper100",,,,,,,,"Mall Road near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Mall Road","near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate","3418119","31.09695","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17689","Hotel Marina","411","4.2","17","17","39","143","195","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d3418119-Reviews-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://marinashimla.com"

Every shopping place like Mall Road, Lakkar bazar, Tibetian market is at walkable distance. Most  comfortable thing is that car can go till hotel otherwise all other hotels on Mall Road is no accessible by car as vehicles are not allowed in shopping area. Rooms are specious and clean. Food is tasty. Only we had issue with the South Indian dishes they provide in breakfast. Their batter for vada, idli and uttappa are very sour. Coconut chutney also tasteless.

This hotel struck me as having the smartest room lighting I have ever seen. There are many switches for all sorts of room lighting to make sure you have just the right areas lit. The bathroom is also very good. It only has a shower , but a big shower, hot water very reliable and is much safer than showering in slippery baths.

"Highly Disappointing","2","2019-08","2019-08-20","We were delighted to book Hotel Marina thinking that it is on Mall Road and would be a good Experience but it proved to be a bad and disappointing experience at all. First of all we booked Deluxe Garden Room which didn't have any window forget good outside view. Although Room was full of Luxury but our Home & Bedroom is also not less than a luxurious one. Anybody going to Hill Station would like to have outside view and Window for fresh mountain air which we are unable to take in Delhi. There was no area in whole Hotel where we can sit and enjoy nature, Disastrous.

Other thing happened at Checkout when Reception Staff told us that Bathmat is missing from Room. We told them that it was not there and we also didn't bother as we didn't notice that. A person booking a Room @ 10k per night and Drinking Coffee @ 250 in Hotel will take Rs. 100 Mat. It was height of unprofessional-ism and absence of mind.

Dear Guest,

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

It is quite unfortunate to hear from you that you did not have a good experience at the Marina Shimla particularly with our reception behavior and view from the room. I will definitely take this up with my team and make sure such things do not occur again in the future. About deluxe garden rooms which you have booked those rooms are not having valley view and it is clearly mentioned we have other rooms category which are having good valley view and also we have open terrace  where you can relaxed and enjoy the nature of hills.   

Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused.

It is an enclosed lobby with artificial grass and sitting areas, common among a line of several room without any partition. It is covered by and well lot artificial Sky view. Good place to hang out but makes u crave for Natural light after a day. Sitting area in the “Garden” is nice cozy place to hangout.

Toilets: Pathetic cleanliness with yellowish towels
Do not book PENTHOUSE: These are rarely used and mostly used for hotel storage as confirmed by one of the hotel house keeping staff. The location of penthouse is right above the hotel club and the loud vibrant music, screams would make your night into a nightmare.
On ground Staff is helpful but managers at the reception are very rude with Zero customer service. 
Do ask for dining bills upon check out as when we asked, they collected from their trash bins for us to verify

Located at a brilliant location. Location cant be better.Located at the heart of Shimla in Mall road., so evening walks you will enjoy. If you have elderly people who cant use stairs, Talk to hotel people before booking. Rather when you book for any hotels in Shimla ask for wheel chair support.

The Best part about this hotel was their proximity to the big shimla parking which is gone now. The parking is squeezed and you can barely find any place there to park. The Hotel seems to be requiring major overhaul to keep up with the newer fancier options available in shimla and while the rooms are well appointed, they do feel aged now. Their buffet is nothing out of the world but their service makes up for it in the restaurant.

First you are not allowed to use hotel lift (it's only for resident guests) 
Second, using public lift again a nightmare where you could had a direct access using hotel lift. It goes to the top (by changing lift) and then you have to come down to catch the hotel lift to reach the restaurant. Normally, it takes 25-30 min. time in casual rush hour.

"Overall average. Location is best","3","2021-10","2021-10-19","First things first. It is probably the best located hotel in Shimla. They have their own lift which opens on the mall road. But the lift entrance from Cart Road is about 50 meters inside from the road, and entry is through the crowded public tourism lift passage. There is no point of alighting. So basically you have to get off from the vehicle on the road (Cart Road) itself, walk 50 mtrs / climb stairs through crowded municipal lift passage, and then reach the hotel lift. Parking is not available, although they help in parking at the municipal parking just opposite the hotel. This is a bit cumbersome and irritating. The rooms are neat and clean, service / housekeeping is good and responsive. ""Luxury"" rooms in new block are very small, with no balcony or view. Windows face the municipal lift and anyone can peep into your room from there. They have a good restaurant and bar, and another cafe (cafe Sol) and bar on top floor. Both are good. The restaurant is very small and expensive, although food is good. They do not reserve tables for their own guests, nor inform when table is available. In house guests also have to wait outside like everyone else, which is very irritating. Would request them to change this policy as I have not seen this anywhere that I have travelled. Even celebrated restaurants in hotels treat their own guests differently and take advance reservations for them. Tariff for lowest category of rooms (luxury) is about 7500/- ($100/-) per night (w/o bf) , which is quite steep for the quality of rooms and overall experience, which is at best average. Had it not been for the location, one could definitely give it a miss.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r815248212-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"804","181479635","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/d1/28/d3/devesh1967.jpg","804","15","258","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/devesh1967","devesh1967","D3B5C2CA4709141444D7C2D340CB2374",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","devesh1967",,,,,,,,"The Mall, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"The Mall",,"588617","31.102173","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17724","Hotel Combermere Shimla","549","3.8","43","28","67","257","154","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d588617-Reviews-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://www.hotelcombermere.com/"

"GREAT LOCATION, UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF!","2","2021-07","2021-07-06","We booked Hotel Combermere after reading through the numerous reviews as we were going to shimla after 5 years to celebrate my birthday.
The only pros/advantage of this hotel is its private lift to the mall.
cons:
 We booked the junior suite room and expected it to be great but the view from the room was disappointing, there was no privacy at all and people walking through the bridge connecting the mall road and the public lift could simply peep into the room. We had to put on the curtains throughout our stay.

The in room dining menu was ridiculously expensive and we largely refrained from ordering food from the menu however, since our 3 year old son traveling along we had to order food at times.At one instance, we requested the room service to prepare suji kheer for the kid but the request was bluntly refused. I personally visited the restaurant and requested the manager, Mr. Chauhan for the kheer but he very rudely refused my request and said that staff is very busy and my request cant be entertained, I asked him if he can do it after an hour or so.. He again refused and told me that sooji was not available in the hotel and it cant be made.We then requested him to make dal without any tadka but they somehow missed the intruction and made the dal with tadka and chillies. We tried calling the room service to make fresh dal but no one picked up the call after repetetive attempts. My son did not eat a single. I called them again the next morning with my request for the kheer but it was again refused. We requested for Khichdi to which they obliged but charged 350 bucks for a bowl of khichdi.
Also, most of the staff members were not wearing the mask.We also faced issue with shower in the bathroom and had to call house keeping to fix the issue 
All in all the location of the hotel is great, bang on the mall road and room size is also decent but, attitude of the in room dining staff needs to be changed and they should should be a little empathic. You do not expect such experience after paying around 12.5k per night.We have never faced such behavior during our stays in the past.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r795811140-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"50","126307275","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/87/4b/cb/ashish4787.jpg","50","23","54","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashish4787","Ashish4787","0EA4C742BA032FC631F41E487F6FB8A8",,,,,"Ashish4787",,"Sales","795932287","en","2021-07-07","Rakesh Sharma","Dear Guest,

"Worst management ever seen during my travel ","1","2021-03","2021-03-15","We booked 4 rooms for our much awaited family holiday after a long year of COVID travelling with 2 infants, 1 kid and 1 senior citizen. 

The first night we couldn’t sleep till 3:30 AM because of 9 boys partying in the next room with open doors and loud music with smoke in the entire corridor, the hotel felt like a cheap third grade bar. 

After our repeated calls and written complaint to the manager in the night nothing was done for almost 1 hour. We were reassured that this will not be repeated the next night and appropriate actions has been taken and therefore we decided to trust the hotel.

The next night repeat of the issue made it obvious that the manager on duty brushed the complaint under the carpet and on further investigating, to our horror, we found out that the senior management / GM was not aware of the written complaint. 

The manger on duty provide incorrect number of the GM when we demanded for it the previous night. This just reflects lack of commitment to customer service or their issues. 

Only good thing about the hotel is the location, it’s poorly managed and the rooms are not worth the amount we are paying for our holiday.

"Worst Christmas 2020 in Hotel Combermere Shimla.","1","2020-12","2021-01-03","Such a brand name in itself in Shimla but they have provided the worse services ever seen. 

We booked 2 rooms from 25th Dec 2020 - 27 Dec 2020.

On arrival, the rooms were not cleaned and were stinky also. This is when they had confirmed the arrival time 3 hours earlier.

On Xmas 2020, buffet dinner was served and it was all cold. Guests had to wait long for the chapattis. Moreover after making you wait for half an hour for the dessert, in the name of gulab jamun they give rasgulla. 

On 27th dec morning (cold breezy wind is outside) when there is huge rush at breakfast and guests are waiting, the management didnt permit the staff to accommodate the guests in the covered area instead ask to sit in cold open only. 

*In case you complaint about the services , instead of resolving the same they will blame you back. *

*Worst management specially Mr Rakesh Sharma and Mr Chauhan. * Hotel is understaffed.

At breakfast, only 4 staff persons were available who were running to complete the orders. Security guards are made to lift luggage.

Eventhough we booked for 2 night stay we vacated next day and moved to another hotel nearby and due to various issues the reception staff didn't bother to sort. Defintely this is not a 3 star hotel as mentioned everywhere. The reception staffs attitude and behaviour to the guests needs to change and shouldn't lie to the guests when asking for help. Rooms are big, restaurent good and location is great. The rooms are so cold and won't survive without an heater. The bedding is old and rough and has seen good days.

"THE BEST LOCATION IN THE TOWN","4","2019-09","2019-09-16","A very nice property bang on the most sought after tourist place, The Mall, in Shimla, the Queen of Hills. The best thing about this property is Location, Location and Location. This property has got its own private lift to take you to this hotel and also to take you to the Mall, saving your time, money and effort to go through the Government Tourist Department lift to reach the Mall.
If you are driving, Valet parking is provided free but the parking is paid.
The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and comfortable providing you nice view of the valley in front, some rooms are provided with balconies also.
The staff is polite and courteous, providing service with smile. The House Keeping Service was very prompt. The Hotel Manager, Mr. Rana takes personal interest in making your stay comfortable. There were some minor issues with our room which were promptly taken care of by Mr. Rana.
The complimentary breakfast was fairly good and tasty. The F & B Manager, Mr. Chouhan and his staff was taking good care of all our requirements. They have very nice restaurant called ‘Café Sol’ on 8th floor with opening to the Mall. This restaurant offers very nice, tasty and well presented Continental cuisine (other cuisine also served). The food is prepared in a modern, very neat and clean open kitchen.
Popular tourist attractions, such as, Town Hall, Gaiety Theater, Scandal Point, The Ridge, Church etc are within walking distance of this property. Similarly the best shopping experience in Shimla is available on  The Mall itself.
I would like to highly recommend this property for stay during your visit to Shimla.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r710237311-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"298","244867218","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/98/60/92/coljpsingh.jpg","298","107","279","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coljpsingh","coljpsingh","143C38E9F14737B5EB7871900A406F34",,"297596","Chandigarh, India","Chandigarh","coljpsingh",,"Owner","710561740","en","2019-09-17","HOTELCOMBERMERE","Dear Guest,

"Worst experiences at Hotel Combermere","1","2019-05","2019-05-19","We stayed for 4 nights at hotel combermer shimla to celebrate our marraige anniversary. 

At time booking and there after also i was in touch with Mr. Rana Manager and he over call showed big big pictures.

After i checked in i was surprise to see instead of big picture rhe picture was worst.

Very poor service, the quality of food is worst, Mr Rana promised to arrange cack for marraige anniversay but after waiting for whole day at 11.30 he sent which i refused to accept. 

MR. RANA is not a good manager and he is not reliable and he is not at all men of comitment.the room service is also very poor.

Overall according to my experience i will not recommend hotel combermere to stay.

"Pathetic Hotel and Staff","1","2018-06","2018-06-27","We visited shimla last week and stayed in this over-hyped hotel. I booked 2 executive rooms and paid hefty sum for that. We went to shimla for relaxing for a day but this hotel screwed everything!!! Sleepless night!!
-Check in: The front office lady lied that top floor rooms are sold out. I went to check and found that all rooms were vacant. Very bad.
-As there was some marriage party that day, the whole night we suffered due to extreme nuisance. Somebody was literally banging on the roof. Pathetic!
-We thanked god.. the party finished at around 1-2 AM.. Thn... Real surprise... The pathetic air conditioner of one of the rooms started leaking water like a waterfall...and that too at 4:00 AM...  All our luggage and clothes got wet. We called the reception ! A sleepy guy comes and said it will take 1-2 hours to rectify it!!! Wonderful!!! Shame on them!!! Our kids were crying !!! No maintenance at all !!
-Breakfast: Pathetic again! We requested the waiter 10 times for poori and paranthas... service was extremely slow...No cold coffee in container..
-We complained all this to another sleepy manager Mr.Vishal sharma... nothing !!! He said action will be taken... till date i have not received any reply from this so called 4 star property!!!

"Good Hotel but not that value","3","2018-06","2018-06-17","Here are my observations for Marina:

Pros:
1) LOCATION is key - 10 min walk to main RIDGE and all near by
2) Well maintained modern/contemporary hotel with luxurious rooms.
3) All rooms are Valley view and good roof bar/restaurant

Cons:

"Worst hospitality. They cheated us. Never book from makemytrip.com.","1","2018-04","2018-06-12","Very sad on a 4 star hotel not providing basic amenities as promised to the customer. Not addressing customer problem. After 2 hrs of my literally fighting for my right with hotel people and @makemytrip people. I still get this answer. On their site they say a/c room available but a/c abhi on nahi hai.. I got these different answers for mmt and hotel staff. 
1. Ek room ke liye ac on karenge toh sab rooms ka chalega. Occupancy problem hai. 
2. A.c on hi nahi hai
3. Temperatureof shimla is 12 degree. It doesnot need ac
4. Another one says ac is not on for this season. 
5. Then a gentleman comes and says. Its on heating mode. 
7. Even if they switch on the ac it will take 3-4 days to start cooling mode
6. They are happy to provide me a table fan

Talking on make my trip customer care. They offer me a series of solution
FYI.. tag line of mmt assured scheme is “HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE HOTEL.. we resolve your problem in 60 mins or stay is free.”
One hour into the talks with four different personnels of mmt I get a series of solution and a hang-up. 
1. Temp of shimla is 12 degree. You dont need an ac.
2. Ac is on heating as other guests require heating and because ac is centrally controlled. 
3. All we can do is we can cancel the booking and you can GO AHEAD AND  book another hotel in the area from our site. 
4 when i demanded a full refund. They offered me 25 % instead of their 100% claim as per site.  
5 to top it all I got this message of 100 rs refund on hourly basis till my problem is solved.

"Great property minus hospitality","3","2018-04","2018-04-23","I stayed with family for 3 days in the Executive room.

The hotel property and infrastructure are amazing. It is walking distance from the Mall Road with ample parking space. The rooms are spacious and luxurious. The view is just fair – it overlooks the town. The food – it is one of the best in town. For all three days, we ordered atleast one meal at the hotel and it was great all the time. Their chef and F&B team are amazing.

Inspite of all the good things, the service standards leave you gasping for more. The frontdesk is unwelcoming. I observed the same when they interacted with other guests as well. They do not entertain any requests. For example, there was a reluctance in giving 1 extra quilt; there was a reluctance in pushing the check-out time by 15 minutes; there was a reluctance in serving one extra glass of refreshment; there was reluctance in modifying our package from EP to CP (we were willing to pay for it); etc. However, the housekeeping and porter/security staff were very helpful.

A stay at Marina is definitely expensive. I did not get my money’s worth

My suggestion to Marina’s owners – you have invested in a great asset (infrastructure). Please do invest in people and hospitality to make this hotel better.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d3418119-r575153537-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"578","232615734","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/dd/6f/36/agg-ashu.jpg","578","34","36","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761ashutosha","ashutosh a","FCD87D7884782DF833575E7AF0E9942A",,"644043","Noida, India","Noida","761ashutosha",,,,,,,,"Mall Road near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Mall Road","near Kamla Nehru Hospital, Milsington Estate","3418119","31.09695","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17689","Hotel Marina","411","4.2","17","17","39","143","195","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d3418119-Reviews-Hotel_Marina-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://marinashimla.com"

They do not have twins rooms but will split a Double bed for you.  The mattress was old and worn and the sleep was not comfortable.  They were dipping in the middle which spoilt our stay.  The bathroom was modern and the shower was a great size, no bath which was fine by us.  It has a good sized Gym and the restaurant was quite good too.  If i came to Shimla again i think i would try another hotel nearer the middle of the Mall, not that i would come to Shimla again.

"Very good","4","2018-03","2018-03-18","Visited this place for lunch. Ordered a Non-veg platter, Sicilian Punch, Paneer Lababdar and Tandoori roti. I ve dined at almost all restaurants in and around Shimla including Oberoi Cecil, Wildflower and Radisson. Not once have i been satisfied with the quality of food. Poor quality non veg, rotten fish at times, over cooked and dry tikkas, or sometimes even sour paneer; not to mention the exorbitant prices...  i cd sum up my eating out experience at Shimla like this. Marina however was a pleasant experience. I went to this place on some friend's suggestion. I am glad i did. The non veg platter was excellent. Chicken and mutton and fish was melting in the mouth. Best part was that the non veg was absolutely fresh. For Rs.800, it was not bad at all. I wont say it was not over priced because Shimla on the whole is overpriced. The scicilian punch at about Rs.530... was definitely super priced and was average. The Paneer lababdar and rotis were amazing. Serving was good. The staff was courteous and sensitive to our requirements. Over all a very pleasant lunch. Will definitely visit this place and try out all their stuff.

"Lovely Room with a Great View","3","2024-11","2024-11-23","We stayed here for 3 nights whilst in Shimla. Our room was big, stylish, and had a balcony with a great view.  Breakfast was pretty good, and we had the buffet dinner on our first night, which  wasn't bad.  The public areas are  nicely decorated. Whilst we enjoyed our stay, we felt that some of the staff needed further training and were pretty lacklustre. Also we couldn't seem to get our room very warm and the hotel corridors and restaurant were all pretty cold. We had massages whilst there and the room was cold despite the staff trying to locate heaters. The complimentary shuttle bus to the mall isn't complimentary in that it costs, and you would still need to walk uphill to the Mall.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r981579523-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","412","335","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTK","TTK","95085A594E42CE2E5AC9988B2D67447A",,"186273","Brighton, United Kingdom","Brighton","TTK",,"Guest Services / Front Office","990183094","en","2025-01-22","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest,

We were met on our arrival with a welcome drink and biscuits, the view from the reception area is quite breathtaking and we enjoyed watching the monkeys frolfrolicking outside the window.
Our room also afforded us a fabulous view and we particularly enjoyed the basket of fruit and biscuits that were left complimentary with our tea/coffee and water.
The buffet breakfast and evening meals were of exceptional quality with a great mix of western and Indian dishes.
Alcoholic drinks were a little on the expensive side but the service was always with a smile.

"Disappointing","3","2024-10","2024-11-02","We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and while it is comfortable and clean, overall we found it a bit of a disappointment. 

1. When we arrived we were shown to a beautiful suite, but it didn’t have the hot tub described and given the amazing location, our view was of the carpark! When we complained we were shown to a smaller room with a great hillside view and given the choice of the 2, so we chose the 2nd one. But we had booked a suite, so lost out on the deal. 
*Be aware that the photos they show of the suites have the curtains closed, clearly to hide the fact you don’t get a hillside view.*
2. The next issue was the hairdryer, the only plug point near a mirror was faulty so the plug wouldn’t stay in the socket. We informed reception who kept sending new hairdryers, each time we explained what the issue was by showing them, but despite being told maintenance would come, it wasn’t fixed during our stay meaning the hairdryer was unusable.
3. The air conditioning in our room was really inconsistent and fairly ineffective, meaning you woke up hot and uncomfortable in the night.
4. We booked some treatments at the spa, we returned to the hotel especially to have these treatments, but on arrival were told they couldn’t go ahead due to the noise from building work. We said we didn’t mind the noise, the staff then admitted it was their Diwali celebration so they couldn’t not do the treatments for us. So basically they had lied. Plus no one had contacted us to advise the appointments had been cancelled meaning some of our limited time in Shimla was wasted. 
5. Reception staff were all very pleasant and friendly, but whatever you asked them, they asked you to take a seat while they looked into your query. It felt like no one could make a decision or answer a question without checking with a superior first.
We just didn’t feel this hotel lived up to the Radisson brand or the cost charged for the rooms, so can’t recommend it as a choice for staying in Shimla.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r978350198-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"412","29356747","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/bf/f2/cb/mrsp-somerset.jpg","550","125","266","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsP-Somerset","MrsP-Somerset","4F0F91E4CE748FEED5BFCBEBA9F09C58",,"190730","Taunton, United Kingdom","Taunton","MrsP-Somerset",,"Guest Services / Front Office","999323514","en","2025-03-23","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest, We apologize for the inconvenience caused and have taken the corrective measure to ensure our guest gets the best of experience.

"Well Located Hotel Offering Excellent Service In Every Respect","5","2024-10","2024-10-25","We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a Business Suite, partly because I am a long term member of the Radisson Rewards scheme. 

The hotel offers excellent views over part of Shimla and is only a short (1km?) walk from The Ridge. For those who do not fancy walking on Indian roads, however, a shuttle service is provided to the base of a staircase leading to Christ Church. 

Breakfast covers a very wide range of foods, including Indian and western offerings, and the cappuccinos are the equal of any I’ve had on numerous visits to Italy. The a la carte dinner menu is extensive and portions were very large (and extremely tasty) while a buffet is also offered whenever there are tour groups staying at the hotel.

All staff throughout the hotel were well-mannered, pleasant and helpful when needed and taxis/transfers were provided in an efficient manner using well maintained cars and safe, sensible drivers.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r976554017-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"3458","87161368","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/31/fa/18/tabascoleathergrain.jpg","3456","139","160","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tabascoleathergrain","Tabascoleathergrain","E6083FC743308065E99CA1C34AE3CE15",,,,,"Tabascoleathergrain",,"Guest Services / Front Office","990183217","en","2025-01-22","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest,

"Amazing stay and experience ","5","2024-08","2024-08-31","Just finished our holiday to India and the Radisson Jass was our last stop. This hotel was ideal, location perfect Just a short walk to Mall Rd, but the hotel does run a shuttle service to Auckland tunnel. The hotel is quirky in its lay out, but you have to understand it is built on the side of a mountain. Food was delicious, listen to the staff as the portions are massive. Housekeeping immaculate, with some lovely designs on our bed, Barkha was our keeper and she was star. Cant think of any bad points. Spa is good value too. Highly recommend and was a perfect end to our trip!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r967697329-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452386713","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","1200","20","163","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PCLNadventures","PCLNadventures","D96DFEDC6E9DE2F5CB923590E4AED635",,,,,"PCLNadventures",,"Guest Services / Front Office","971248640","en","2024-09-24","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest,

"Worst in shimla","1","2024-05","2024-05-23","Most pathetic service. First they had us for half n hour while we were settling up. They handed us 2 room keys as we were 2 couples with a 4 years old kid. When we reached the room we saw that the room was already open and messed up (It was not cleaned up). When asked they said it ll take 15 min to do so but it took half n hour. My kid was so hungry that he started getting restless. When asked about what kind of service is this, Mr. Dinesh (duty manager) replied that “aapka check in waise bhi 3 baje ka hai and aapko humne isiliye 1 room available kiya hai”. He dint even know that his staff had handed us 2 keys stating that rooms are ready. He was rude in replying as it took us 4.30 pm to enter the room which messed our whole day s plan. He offered us 25% discount on food and be beverages which were already hiked up to 18% gst. So effectively it was merely 7%. On top of that room dint have shower or hair dryer working. When we asked for food in the night billing was not proper and they had to recheck it. On the next day when we were checking out they wasted our 1 hour just in luggage pick up (sloppy service). We had an extra bed but that was also broken…… i would really not recommend this hotel to even my enemies. If you dont have interest in running a hotel stop taking bookings.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r952111697-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452389009","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1200","0","31","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camper43985424787","Hemal Shah","4520BE1BD6E25A3F4CEB41E633B2BA5B",,"297608","Ahmedabad, India","Ahmedabad","Camper43985424787",,"Guest Services / Front Office","999323762","en","2025-03-23","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest, We apologize for the inconvenience caused and have taken the corrective measure to ensure our guest gets the best of experience.

Only minus is that they charge too much as compare to other 4 star hotels. If someone get this hotel in the range of 4000 then its good value for money.

"Fun filled trip","5","2019-01","2019-01-12","Hotel combermere has one obvious advantage over many prominent properties that it's private lift opens directly into busy Mall road and also touches main highway below at lift near parking. It's an easy walk to Ridge from the hotel. I booked 2 rooms from 7th to 10th jan 2019 for my family having 5 yr and 12 yrs old daughters and 70 yr old mother. All age groups enjoyed yo the fullest. Your car can reach uptil lift from where their drivers park the vehicle in the public parking which is paid @Rs 180/ day.
Rooms are okay, higher floors like 502,503,402, 403 offer better view as compared to other rooms. When we reached there these rooms were not available but the manager allowed us to change the rooms very next day to 502,503.This was a good gesture on hotel part.
Staff is very helpful and smiling all the time.
Breakfast spread was OK but  can be better and can include more choices. Too much of the repetition in it. Central heating was very good especially when outside temp was -3 and -4℃. 24 hrs hot and cold water was available. No water problem at all which I heard was an imp issue in several other hotels in shimla. 
Beware of step while entering in washrooms. 
Cafe SOL was good for serving international cuisines. 
Checkin and checkout was hastle free.
Bakery products are famous in shimla and good bakeries are available within 100m on either side on mall road.
If want to eat outside then Nalini restaurant is right adjoining along with Shere-Punjab which serve all indian choices. 
All in all this property is a good choice for vacation if you get a
Reasonable deal.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r645440041-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452389859","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","1200","5","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dRPUNEET","dRPUNEET","17708C3DB47064B5CB60BA86D076C452",,,,,"dRPUNEET",,"Sales","784705047","en","2021-03-17","Rakesh Sharma","Thanks sir......","The Mall, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"The Mall",,"588617","31.102173","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17724","Hotel Combermere Shimla","549","3.8","43","28","67","257","154","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d588617-Reviews-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","http://www.hotelcombermere.com/"

"Ideal hotel to stay in Shimla","5","2018-06","2018-06-20","We stayed in a Luxury room for a couple of days. 
Room: Spacious, well furnished with fridge and facilities for tea and coffee. Towel and toiletries. 2 criticisms: a) The view was not good as it looked out onto a construction site beside the tourism lift. b) We would have preferred a cot for the third person but was provided with a mattress on the floor instead, which was slightly disappointing. 
However, fantastic views from the common balconies, the bar and the open air restaurant.
Service: Courteous and prompt.
Food: Fantastic choices both at the restaurant and the cafe at the top. Generous portions. Reasonable prices. Great breakfast spread including bacon and sausages.
Location: The entry to the reception is from Cart road and the other access is from the Mall. So, great location. However, the initial steep climb up the stairs from Cart road can be slightly challenging for the elderly.
Overall: Ideally located hotel with great food and prompt service. Ideal for families. Despite the minor issues mentioned above, highly recommended.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r589190431-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,,,,,"9","36","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/458jaic","Jai C","6E1D55837E810033ED173CAC462F2EA2",,,,,"458jaic",,"Front Office Manager","596946324","en","2018-07-17","HOTELCOMBERMERE","Dear Guest,

"Perfect location !! Nice hotel.","5","2018-05","2018-05-25","Perfect location and private lift are two major points for which you should go for this hotel. There are long queque for public paid lift. 
Ambience is good, nicely done decor , mountain view terrace is awesome specially at night. 
Rooms are small but clean and with all basic amenities.
Reception is a bit non impressive. 
They don't have own parking so u have to opt for govt parking thats too costly , we paid 600 RS for two days. But its nearby. No space for driver.
Food is delicious but costly, they have  barbique at terrace. But I would suggest you should opt for accommodation only in this hotel coz there are many options in Simla. You can explore other eateries nearby. 
Other amenities are there... Spa, health club. Best part was live music played at bar.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r582762417-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452388761","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","1200","14","59","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ramabansal29","Ramabansal29","08CBCF98BCF2773B4F24E98C8F7A7449",,"4915162","Fatehabad, India","Fatehabad","Ramabansal29",,"Front Office Manager","596944551","en","2018-07-17","HOTELCOMBERMERE","Dear Guest,

"Dated property, good location","3","2018-03","2018-04-23","We stayed for a couple of nights in March 2018. First of all getting into Shimla itself took several hours for the last few kilometres - there is a serious congestion problem with this place - someone should sort it out. When you finally get to the hotel the tax can only drop you off on a very busy road. You then have to call reception and hope someone can help you with your bags. 
The hotel is located in a building site where they are building a new  lift and more parking. After waiting ages for someone to help us with the luggage I ended up lugging it through the building site, up lots of stairs and finally to the hotels private lift. Eventually you get to a pokey little reception area and when you finally check in you are led through some gloomy passages, up another lift to your room. The rooms are barely adequate, reminding me of Indian hotels from 30 years ago. Similarly the restaurant is dark and dingy not helped by dark wood paneling every where. 
Once you are settled in and find your way to the Mall (the main Shimla shopping street) things start to get a bit better and you find the location is ideal. The views from the hotel and the lifts are excellent, especially in the evening. The Mall and surrounding areas are a delight - loved the walk to the Vice regal lodge along the heritage walk. Also enjoyed the trek to Jakoo Mandir - the monkeys were great - they definitely have a game plan to extract goodies from the visitors. You'll probably find better hotels in Shimla but this is probably in the best location.
(And by the way the WIFI is useless).","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r575278436-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452392029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","4","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PPandha","PPandha","B6A820A1CC93C7421547A51C12C0F5F7",,,,,"PPandha",,"Front Office Manager","597260926","en","2018-07-18","HOTELCOMBERMERE","Dear Guest,

"Avoid if Possible","1","2017-07","2017-07-23","Booked 3 rooms in this hotel for one night as we had to travel further ahead. We reached the hotel around 3:30 pm and still the rooms given to us were not ready in spite of us calling up ahead and telling them our time of arrival.
After some discussion at the reception they gave us upgraded rooms but these rooms were not clean at all, the bathrooms were smelling and the linen was also not very clean.
 Nothing in the hotel is complimentary i mean they don,t even provide an iron and want you to send your clothes to the laundry for pressing which is very expensive.
As far as food is concerned we had breakfast at the hotel and all i can say is that  the food quality was below average. Even for a regular thing like an omelette was not prepared well and was almost swimming in oil.
We paid 7500 per room and i don't think this place is worth even that much.
The only good thing about this hotel is that its on the Mall and has private lift access . Apart from this there is nothing positive i can say about this place so if possible avoid staying here.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r504990690-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"3024","491833573","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/50/c8/e5/confu.jpg","3024","10","42","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Confu","Saurabh","D59A5D6471A116BA05D1B0D82CC1329F",,,,,"Confu",,"Front Office Manager","505417407","en","2017-07-25","HOTELCOMBERMERE","Dear Sir,

"Iconic Hotel Combermere has become Worst","2","2017-06","2017-06-14","The iconic hotel of Shimla The Hotel Combermere has become worst hotel. The services provided by this star hotel is just like any ordinary lodge. Their Management is least bothered about their brand. The reason for this worst tag is My room of worth around 10k plus was having bed bugs and when we complaint about it to Mr Manager, he took action and changed it. I must say only Mr Rana is the person on which this hotel is getting its guest. Then shifted to new room the problem related to housekeeping services started. When ever we have to avail any service we have to dial three to four times then our demand was catered. Their food is no doubt good, but good food is also not appreciated if it's service is poor. Their service at the terrace area is pathetic. Their service people are good in ignoring you, they don't make eye contact with you, they simply just ignore you. This was not with us but with every table present at that time. Everyone was just having few things and then leaving as no one could wait more to have more things. I later on came to know that the new property in Shimla HOTEL MARINA on Mall Road is also their sister concern. I wonder how that property would be. I just want to convey they should really improve their service and service staff in every operation area.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d588617-r493043928-Hotel_Combermere_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452386394","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/335rachita","Rachit A","B8395C1057BB577FD20BF830AD9C6D15",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","335rachita",,"Front Office Manager","512572701","en","2017-08-14","HOTELCOMBERMERE","Dear Guest

"Absolutely Pathetic Maintenance and Insensitive Staff","2","2017-06","2017-06-13","This is in reference to above for my stay in their Luxury Room on 5th Floor just 2 days ago, I wish to inform you that the stay in your Hotel was extremely unpleasant and pathetic

Mr.Harish Thakur, the Night Manager available on Extn.804 simply refused to boil the child`s milk despite repeated requests for the same on all days. He told me come what may Hotel has no policy of allowing to boil a child`s milk even if he dies of hunger. He wanted us to buy the milk from Hotel only whether child likes the taste or not.

Secondly maintenance was in such pathetic and bad shape that whilst taking bath the clothes rod fall on my wife`s shoulder injuring her hand and shoulder badly. I highlighted it to everyone from Maintenance to Reception, quite shamelessly no body felt apologetic and were only interested in fixing the issue. I wanted to lodge a Police Complaint but my wife stopped me from doing so.  Even on check in the Hotel  Room, Remote for LED was not available and  on being inquired about the same now I was given a remote by Housekeeping but without battery in it. again after half an hour batteries were found by this lethargic Staff and I was given the remote.( Wonder what facilities your Hotel is providing in such exorbitant price)

I lodged a complaint also about above said incidents in a complaint format as enclosed, but I am quite sure it will not be allowed to reach the correct authority in Hotel, hence writing this Review as well. I know that this is gonna fall on Deaf ears but I will certainly highlight this  so that no body in future is victimised like I am.

As you enter mall road, you can actually see the most beautiful cafe and it belongs to this hotel. Super amazing, i would love to be here next time. Couldn't book due to unavailability. 

Has Gym, Spa, Mani-Pedi and rooftop restaurant with live music

"Hostel rather than a Hotel","2","2024-05","2024-05-10","Maybe this Hotel owner thinks that their name is such that people will come thronging but I really didn't my stay here.
1. Location is not good. First you face a jam till auckland tunnel and then It's a single road leading to hotel that again faces traffic jams very often.
2. Staff is not good either. The security guard outside will surely welcome you with a smile but that's where it ends as people are not cooperative inside.
a)The Menu card in the room says B'fast is served till 7-11 am but if you ask the room service at 10.40 am to send you something, they straightaway say NO.
b)To my surprise, Visitors are not allowed after 8-9 pm in the room. We had a friend visiting us at 9 pm for dinner and a hotel guy-Rakesh stopped him from going to our room saying Hotel policy didn't allow this. Nowhere this is mentioned while checking in or on website but this hotel is creating their own policies.

The layout of the hotel might cause problems for people with mobility issues. It is spread out, and includes many steps which this altitude did cause my wife and I  slight shortage of breath when negotiating the steps in order to get to the dining room.

The Wi-Fi in the rooms however is very poor at times and whilst my iPhone was able to connect sometimes my iPad didn’t at all.

There is no bar as such, but drinks are available in the Lobby/Lounge area. I was able to buy alcohol late afternoon but a fellow traveler was not apparently until 7.00pm

"Disapponting disgusting n a disaster.","3","2023-06","2023-06-14","It was a very bad n disappounting experience staying at Radisson jass shimla.
Parking was so full that wen v arrived there was no place left to even enter the hotel.
Rooms had a very gud view but floor was too slippery...almost all of us were abt to fall 3 to 4 times. Bathrooms were not so gud.
Not enoughToiletries/bathrobes were not there. No hairdryer was available.
Food was also not up to the mark as expected.
But only the restuarant staff n the security guys were the best that v liked at the property...really commendable people.
Radisson Goa is the vest..but Radisson jass is no where near to it...disgusting
I wld never recommend it to any1 in family n friends.
We booked 3 rooms 20000 per night that too meals were nt included n the buffet for which v had to pay was not worth the price...Waste of money.
I expect if Radisson can even do anythg for spoiling our holiday.

"Heritage My Backside ","1","2018-03","2018-03-23","Calling this a heritage hotel is like slapping a label on a tin of baked beans and calling it caviar. 
We were given room 104 and it was bloody awful. Period furniture??
I don't think you can call a grotty wardrobe that your Auntie Vera or but chucked out in 1967 'period'.
The Windows didn't fit properly and i was freezing all night (arriving from Delhi probably made it worse). There was an electric bar heater that didn't heat the room as it was all going out of the gaps between the window and frame. 
The hotel was noisy with inconsiderate people talking loudly until late and then at 6.45am I was woken by the sound of hawking, coughing and spitting. 
There did seem to be other rooms that were nicer than ours and the breakfast smelt nice although we hurried out of there so quickly we didn't stop to eat or stay the second night we'd paid for. 
I have to say that in a month of travelling round India this was the worst accommodation of them all.

"Terrible Experience before our stay","1","2018-02","2018-02-19","Well! We were 4 couples with a confirmed booking at this hotel for 4 rooms and the booking was done via booking.com. This hotel is managed by OYO rooms and fellow travelers/guests-Beware!!!! Our booking was confirmed on a basis of pay when you stay but just before 2-3 days of my check-in date i started to get calls from OYO rooms customer service located in Gurugram. I was asked to pay 25% of the total room rent in advance which i was ready to pay as my travel and check-in was confirmed. But OYO rooms customer service provided me with a link to proceed with the payment and guess what! the link asked me to pay the entire amount for 4 rooms for 3 nights-In Advance. Upon numerous calls and emails, i was advised by OYO rooms that they hotel had no rooms to accommodate my booking as no rooms were available. Needless to say - Stay away from hotels under the tag of OYO Rooms. very unpleasant experience.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144763-r561525563-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"450","410642903","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/79/e9/d7/caption.jpg","450","10","81","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mishra_sarthak","Sarthak Mishra","7D9798B99909ED6793BB14CB5729694E",,"297586","Hyderabad, India","Hyderabad","mishra_sarthak",,"Guest Relations Manager","568884528","en","2018-03-26","Puneet C","We are sorry to hear about the booking issue that you had with OYO Rooms, We will definitely ask them to make it more flexible regarding the bookings and we would like you to come again to Shimla and experience the hospitality of our Hotel.

"Nice hotel near Shimla Mall","5","2017-10","2017-10-30","Alpine Heritage Residency Inn is a good hotel situated at Tailand, Cart Road around one km away from the Mall area of Shimla.  It was once a bungalow belonging to an Englishman has now been renovated to a hotel. Despite of being near heart of the city, it is situated at a very peaceful and calm area. Hotel manager G.S Rana and Assitant Manager Mr Aditya Chauhan are very nice person, always helpful. This hotel has 19 rooms for guests, many of them are valley view. As it is a small property so even when it is fully occupied, then also seems not so crowded. Service is fine and suitable for family stay. The only limitation is there is scarcity of parking place in the hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144763-r537039865-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1024","440664757","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/44/02/b5/sunirmal-m.jpg","1888","236","306","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunirmalM1","Sunirmal M","306CAB112A2398A2E23726981EC6E25A",,,,,"SunirmalM1",,"General Manager","568887802","en","2018-03-26","AdityaTP","Dear Guest, thanks for your stay at Hotel Alpine Heritage.

"Avoid if you can","1","2016-09","2016-09-10","The reception staff was extremely bad behaved and inhospitable.

They were offering me the breakfast which was include as part of my tariff on the next day of my arrival. The funny part was, i was checking in and out the same day. And i has personally called the hotel front desk 2 times prior toi my arrival (2 days prior and 1 day prior), to confirm my reservation and check-in/check-out schedule. Totally absurd!!

""Alpine Residency"" is heritage property ,provided 2 rooms # 401 /402 with Rs 4500 first day without breakfast .
Hotel rooms were cosy , scenic beauty from rooms .  
Next day I used OYO to book same rooms with breakfast with Rs 3750 .
Hotel stay was good 3.5/5 , but restaurant was not good 2/5 .
There is no option for food/tea/cofee nearby to hotel .
Manger didnt provide original bill .
Please negotiate well .
They dont have own parking space ,but they are offering ;) . Looks like every other hotel is doing like that in Shimla .

"Very Good Location of the Hotel","5","2016-11","2017-03-18","Very Good Location of the Hotel

The hotel is very well located on the Mall Road. Shimla. Whereas food and other amenities are concerned, the same are good and one enjoys the stay because of the fact that the hotel is on the main Mall Road; the moment we step out, the Mall starts. The rooms are good and the service is also nice.  

Though, the travellers who reach Shimla by their own cars find it difficult to park their cars and arrange for transportation of their luggage two floors above to the hotel reception. There is no separate parking. The cars are to be parked down at the main road parking (near the Lift) which is again under major repair and the construction work is going on. Overall,l a very good hotel if there are no parking issues and the visitor is travelling by public transport.

"Worst stay ever with arrogant and mannerless staff","1","2017-03","2017-03-11","We visited this so called 4 star hotel on 4 th march 2017 . Everything was going smooth right from the baggage staff till the room service staff . This was our 3 rd visit to the hotel in last 3 years but few  incidents  changed our entire opinion . As we were chilling in the room and so at first we ordered some salads and snacks . After this when we ordered food the room service operator said "" sir aapne jo order karna hai ek baar order kardo baar baar mat ring karo "" . Can u believe it ? I still cannot . Is this called hospitality ? 

We were 3 couples with 2 small kids checking out on 5 th march and we we were heading to kufri and while checking out we requested the staff on the reception to heat the kids milk lying in the refrigerator of our room ( kids cannot be given any kind of milk so we were carrying tetra packs of the milk for kids which were kept in the refrigerator  ) as the kids needed it while travelling to kufri . At first the staff at the reception said "" not to worry "" . While we were checking out the front desk staff Mr ANIL KUMAR casually replied "" sorry we cannot heat the milk "" . At first glace i thought i was hearing a joke but the man was serious . His name is Anil Kumar and is the  most arrogant man i ve come across . After this our wives had to be controlled as no mother can tolerate such an attitude . Any heartless man would have done it but such an answer reveals the mind of management . Inspite of my asking the number of general manager or the owner i was just given  an email and i also know that mail will never reach the higher management . Anyways i m sure my review on this site will reach the higher management and i hope they take swift action to teach there management the spelling of Hospitality .

Located  on the mall .Excellent cafe at the mall level ,great variety,comfortable prices.
The restaurant in the hotel serves good Indian and indianised international and Indochinese cuisine .
Vegetarian breakfast apart from eggs.
But that is to be expected .
Service normally efficient,expect in the night ,when a request is responded to next morning .The staff converse with great gusto at all decibels in the corridors. 
Rooms have good temperature control ,house keeping is efficient.
No tissue boxes ,limited toilet paper,cramped Loo's ,mediocre toiletries (carry your own ).

Positives
1) Location is great.No need  to take public lift as hotel lift is quite near to the car parking area .Hotel lift opens right next to Mall road at top so is quite convenient.
2) Most of the rooms have great valley view.
3) Staff at reception was polite and helpful

Negatives
1) Furnishing is old.Mattresses are shocking. I have never seen such bad quality of mattresses in any 4 star or 5 star hotel
2)Air heater didn't work .They tried to fix it but it gave up again in middle of night.It was quite cold so we couldn't  sleep well.

"Pathetic Rooms, management and hygiene","1","2016-06","2016-06-22","Unfortunately I booked this property thru OYO , which was my first booking with OYO.I spoke to  property manager Rana before confirming on the availability of Driver  for local sight scene as I took my own Car to Shimla, . My nightmare started when I reached ,property has  no proper parking place and no drive was there at all to park my vehicle. If you are not an expert driver  in hill stations  you can not park your vehicle in this hotel . Somehow I managed to park my vehicle, suddenly one attendant came and started  asking   me to move my vehicle to some  other place. I  simply gave  my car key and requested him  to move my car as I was going  to near by  place on foot with my family. When I returned I realized my  mistake, they simply damaged  the key of my car( thank good god, I was carrying the duplicate key) and on my questions  property manager Rana simply said that  the key was already damaged before handed over to them. Lets talk about  room ....was not clean at all cigarette buts were lying in the floor. In bathroom used  towels were there. Food was pathetic.  I observed overcharged  for each and every  taxi bookings for local sight seeings as hotel manager  Rana is a commission agent. In one one instance the  driver ( provided by manager , Rana the hotel manager) fled  with my money  without completing my local sight seeing. As usual the hotel manager did not take any responsibilities, however he took commission from the driver !!

NO NO NO for this property . Wastage of your valuable money and time. And OYO is  worst travel partner they have nexus with such hotels.

"Mixed Experiences at Hotel Alpine Heritage Residency","3","2014-09","2014-10-08","I travelled to Shimla in the month of September 2014 with my family and booked accommodation at Hotel Alpine Heritage Residency. The location of the hotel is good as it is outside from the hustle and bustle of congested Shimla but The Mall is easily accessible from the hotel. And cab can go till the entry gate of the hotel. We chose a Family Suite and the room we were given (room# 501) was located just beside the reception. View of the green valley and hills from the room was good. We stayed there for 3 nights and found the accommodation better than average (if not very good/really satisfied). We got the chance of having a glance at a few other double bedded rooms (most probably The Royal Retreat, The Imperial Bedchamber, The Super Deluxe and Deluxe Bedchambers), while roaming inside the hotel and felt that those double bedded rooms are far better than the family suite given to us in terms of space and quality. The quality of bed was a bit disappointing. Door locks and the condition of the doors, curtain rods, windows were a bit damaged and not properly maintained. Rooms were clean though on the very first day we found a few insects/worms in the room (might be due to non-cleaning of the room for a prolonged period) and we had to call the hotel staffs quite a few times to clean the same. Regarding quality of foods served at the hotel, it was good (though not excellent). Hotel staffs were good and we found them well-mannered and polite. Manager Mr. Rana and Marketing Director Mr. Puneet Chopra - we found both of them very courteous and gentle! They addressed each and every concern of us promptly. Overall, a nice and pleasant stay at Alpine Heritage Residency!

Pros: Location of the hotel, Polite and gentle hotel staffs, clean rooms, quality of service and food is good/satisfactory.
Cons: Need more maintenance (especially for the Family Suite).

Can be recommended for staying at this hotel if a calm and quite stay is preferable","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144763-r233402819-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"205","19820681","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/89/avatar010.jpg","205","9","34","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magnan07","Amit S","BED398B0BF12A49CECB3A0611BF5B208",,,,,"Magnan07",,,,,,,,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate Chotta Shimla, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate"," Chotta Shimla","1144763","31.09284","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17413","Treebo The Alpine Heritage Residency","129","4","15","5","18","15","76","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144763-Reviews-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.treebo.com/hotels-in-shimla/treebo-trend-hotel-the-alpine-heritage-residency-cart-rd-3474/?utm_source=Partnerships&utm_medium=gplus&utm_campaign=hotelthealpineheritageresidency"
"Peaceful Stay","3","2014-08","2014-08-27","I stayed here for three days. It is an old property with all old furniture and rooms.

Bathroom has a musty smell as well.

"I felt deprived","3","2014-07","2014-07-16","I had booked at valley view room. But, as am a single traveler, the receptionist gave me a room at the corner of the hotel. the only view I got was of 2 pine trees and the neighboring house. 
The room was also not special. they need renovation. Just because of two days of stay i didn't complain but was disappointed.
Food is HORRIBLE and HIGHLY OVER PRICED. Don't have food here. i had Chicken Curry, all I could taste was Cumin paste and the Butter Rotis had some some crackling dust on them.
The mall is easily reachable by bus. only Rs. 3 as fare.
the thing i like was the ambiance. Quiet and peaceful. I had to enjoy that by coming out and loitering around. The trip could have been better if I would have been given the room that I paid for.
Hope they don't cheat solo travelers like me in future.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144763-r215812094-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"538","147673507","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/cd/51/a3/yash2014.jpg","538","12","35","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yash2014","Yash2014","7A428A137875D0EA84EAA8A26E7D0940",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Yash2014",,,,,,,,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate Chotta Shimla, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate"," Chotta Shimla","1144763","31.09284","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17413","Treebo The Alpine Heritage Residency","129","4","15","5","18","15","76","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144763-Reviews-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.treebo.com/hotels-in-shimla/treebo-trend-hotel-the-alpine-heritage-residency-cart-rd-3474/?utm_source=Partnerships&utm_medium=gplus&utm_campaign=hotelthealpineheritageresidency"

"Excellent Trip ( Redisson blu 💙 )","5","2023-05","2023-05-07","I had the pleasure of staying at the Redisson Blu hotel recently and I have to say that the staff there was absolutely incredible. Every single member of the staff was friendly, helpful, and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was as enjoyable and comfortable as possible. From the front desk staff who helped us check-in, to the housekeeping staff who kept our room spotless and orderly, to the restaurant staff who served us delicious meals – everyone was professional, courteous, and eager to help. The staff truly made our stay special and I can’t thank them enough for their excellent service. Highly recommended!

The reception staff is truly amazing! Every time I come in, I am greeted with a warm and welcoming smile and the staff is always extremely helpful. The staff is knowledgeable and always willing to help with any questions I may have. I feel comfortable and safe when I come in, and I always leave feeling like a valued customer.
( Housekeeping Staff )
The housekeeping staff is top notch! They are incredibly friendly and always willing to help with any requests. The rooms are always cleaned to perfection and the staff pay close attention to detail. They always go above and beyond to ensure that the guests have a pleasant stay.
( Special thanks to Sahil Sidhu )
I wanted to express my sincerest gratitude for the amazing job you did cleaning my room. You exceeded my expectations and it was greatly appreciated. Your attention to detail and hard work was very impressive.
Thank you again for all of your hard work.

"Stay at Radisson Jass Shimla","5","2023-02","2023-02-17","Ambience: The hotel is very tastefully done with amazing ambience, well to do rooms, and rooms with a view to die for.
Hygiene: the property is slick and span. Very clean and hygienic. The Staff takes extra care to keep things neat and tidy.
Staff: This is the key highlight. The staff from chefs to managers to housekeeping folks to the ones attending the guest at reception of restaurant. They all are very warm and welcoming.
Food: The breakfast buffet spread is diverse and delectable. We also tried dinner buffet once and it was great too. Food preparation is amazing. There is a wide range of menu that you can choose from.
Price: It's a deal worth it. Enough Said 😀
Location: It is a little far (3-4km) from Mall Road and if you are one who loves walking along the hill slopes and sides, this will be a little far from the main sights.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d582837-r879022855-Radisson_Hotel_Jass_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redhead_traveller94","Vickey Soni","DA8164D1C1F52FB9B8D07DD2432F4A82",,,,,"Redhead_traveller94",,"Guest Services / Front Office","880577081","en","2023-03-01","Chaman Sharma","Dear Guest,

The service offered was not that great and needs improvement. The staff is not very helpful and did not really care to help us with planning local sightseeing.

"Good view from room - needs renovation and better service","3","2013-06","2013-06-18","We booked this hotel through our travel agent in Mumbai. It is a small hotel facing the Circular Road opposite Talland. One can access Circular Road only on foot as vehicular access is from Cart Road below. The view from the room was very good. The room that we stayed was small and cozy with a small but nice balcony. But the hotel is in urgent need of renovation. The walls were not clean. Some tiles in the toilet were missing. The carpet in the lobby / dining area has seen better days. Overall structure of the hotel appears good. If one looks closely, then one would realize that the whole place needs a face-lift.    
We would have overlooked these deficiencies but service was found wanting. We booked a taxi through the hotel to drop us at the bus stand for our onward trip to Manali. However, the taxi arrived late by 20 minutes and we almost missed our bus. The person at the hotel counter did not seem to bother and kept on blaming the taxi operator. Also, we had ordered for breakfast and that too did not arrive in time.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144763-r164365002-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"450","53765701","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/34/66/45/sudip9.jpg","301","6","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sudip9","Sudip B","D71976D8FD60AA22642A800EC3028975",,,,,"Sudip9",,,,,,,,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate Chotta Shimla, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate"," Chotta Shimla","1144763","31.09284","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17413","Treebo The Alpine Heritage Residency","129","4","15","5","18","15","76","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144763-Reviews-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.treebo.com/hotels-in-shimla/treebo-trend-hotel-the-alpine-heritage-residency-cart-rd-3474/?utm_source=Partnerships&utm_medium=gplus&utm_campaign=hotelthealpineheritageresidency"

"Not A Bad Experience","3","2012-07","2012-10-04","I and my wife were here in July this year. I'd booked a room earlier and they hotel sent a cab to pick us up from the railway station(chargeable of course). The hotel is a converted bunglow, a quaint property and not in the middle of noise and pollution (Thank God). The rooms were nice for the price. Our friends in the next room had a totally different furniture type than ours. I later learnt that each bedroom was done differently. The hotel is average but the team there is very nice. The hotel was in need of some refurbishment and when we talked to the owner (who happened to be there), he told us that renovation was to begin after the peak season was over. Although it was a nice hotel with nice staff, somehow it lacked the magic to make me want to come back again and again. 
By the way, they have suites also. So, if you are travelling as a group or as a family, you could look at that option. The management was also gracious enough to give us a 20% discount on the room tariff.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144763-r141973729-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"450","38249312","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/47/a3/60/manav10572.jpg","385","77","71","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manav10572","Manav S","BBD81AE21BBDAA1AA45F9F820DF73B66",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","manav10572",,,,,,,,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate Chotta Shimla, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate"," Chotta Shimla","1144763","31.09284","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17413","Treebo The Alpine Heritage Residency","129","4","15","5","18","15","76","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144763-Reviews-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.treebo.com/hotels-in-shimla/treebo-trend-hotel-the-alpine-heritage-residency-cart-rd-3474/?utm_source=Partnerships&utm_medium=gplus&utm_campaign=hotelthealpineheritageresidency"
"Satisfying stay at the ""Alpine Heritage"" - with Colonial type ambience","4","2008-09","2008-11-09","For one of our biking excursions, I & my friend decided to visit Shimla. It was late evening till we manage to leave from Chandigarh (though we had pledged to leave maximum till 4:00p.m.). Thats why, we had to take an overnight halt mid-way & we reached Shimla the next morning. As soon as we reached, we started the search for a hotel. However looking at the population & tourist burst at Shimla nowadays, we absolutely did not want to take-up a hotel in the middle of the town.

We were looking for a peaceful hotel away from the bustling city traffic & noise but not too far to come back walking as well. Thats when after more than an hour of search & checking out a number of hotels, we came accross ""Alpine"". It was an instant hit for us. The hotel had a nice ambience with a British-colonial touch. Also this property was a perfect match according to our needs. I was surprised to see the cleanliness well maintained even in off-seasons! You could barely locate a speck of dust anywhere not only in the room, but also in the lobby, reception, etc. Above all the service was prompt & pretty good with tariff rates optimum. They even co-ordinated with us in arranging for a heater in September as it was drizzling & we were not prepared for such weather!

Overall I would say, the stay at ""Alpine"" was pretty satisfying & enjoying. Belonging to the Cust Srvc industry, I sometimes am very fussy about the service, but here I would say it was absolutely value for money!!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d1144763-r21685895-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html",,"1200","452391659","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg","1200","6","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mailamitbhaskar","mailamitbhaskar","0E164BF663CC738990B1D25CF49C5F52",,,,,"mailamitbhaskar",,,,,,,,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate Chotta Shimla, Shimla 171001 India","Shimla","India","171001",,"Near Stop Opposite Talland Milsington Estate"," Chotta Shimla","1144763","31.09284","Shimla, Shimla District, Himachal Pradesh","77.17413","Treebo The Alpine Heritage Residency","129","4","15","5","18","15","76","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304552-d1144763-Reviews-Treebo_The_Alpine_Heritage_Residency-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html","https://www.treebo.com/hotels-in-shimla/treebo-trend-hotel-the-alpine-heritage-residency-cart-rd-3474/?utm_source=Partnerships&utm_medium=gplus&utm_campaign=hotelthealpineheritageresidency"

The Best - the breakfast spread .. wowww amazing food .. special mention about the Pastry Chef - the cakes - Shimla local apple + oats cake and everything was soo tasty..

Only drawback - would have loved to have the AC / Heater at 28 to 30 degree which was not possible..
