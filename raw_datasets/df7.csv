"A short relaxed stay at O2 Hotel.","4","2023-07","2023-08-05","1. O2 Hotel has been our pit stop from many years when ever we visit Kolkata.
2. The hotel is near to Airport and very convenient for international travellers who plan to visit Kolkata.
3. Anybody wish to have a Pick-up and Drop to airport, the hotel can provide.
4. As usual we did check-in Premium Suite and i just the same for all international travellers.
5. The check-in process is smooth as usual. There is a good choice of variety at buffet breakfast. The food tastes good.
6. Lunch and dinner could be better. Not sure why dishes are too spicy and oily 
7. The tables, cutlery and other utensils are clean.
8. Compare to the pervious years, The in room service became too expensive than ever. Don’t really see the worth in spending 200% more on some times which comes at the same quality in other hotels.

"Ok for a short stay","3","2021-11","2021-11-14","Well I booked it because it was rated as 4* on expedia, rooms were cheap(2 nights stay was cheaper than one night stay in Novotel) and was nearer to the airport.

They charged me ~ INR 450 for an airport drop, which they had mentioned they will charge, but considering I was staying only for 6-7 hrs they could have waived it.

"Great Hotel, Amazing staff","5","2025-08","2025-09-02","Golden Parkk Hotel is perfect for a Westerner that wants excellent customer service, toilet paper, free water (pani in Bengali), and a large room to call home for how ever long your stay. I was in Kolkata for three weeks and only lasted four nights in a hostel here…they are rough! Golden Parkk Hotel is very clean and doesn’t cost a fortune! I paid $52 USD per night and it was worth every dollar! If you want a good nights sleep, ask to not be located on the 4th floor…there is a nightclub on that floor and you can hear the bass thumping all night long. But don’t that deter from staying here! All the staff are so kind and work hard to make you feel welcome every evening when you come back to rest! There is a small sofa, large writing desk, and free WiFi so you can spread out of staying for a while like I did. The Maidan Metro Station is only an easy three minute walk…this stop is basically the middle of the North/South subway line and gives you easy access to wherever you want to go. Park Street is only a 15 minute walk and the Victorian Memorial is another 15. I had a great experience staying here and recommend it with 6 STARS IF I COULD!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r1028170677-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452390416","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freedom04509879046","Freedom04509879046","71C1BD1B2DA7698DE2F95A69BD614241",,,,,"Freedom04509879046",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"Complete AVOID","1","2024-02","2024-02-06","The main reason for using this hotel is visa interviews with US and British visa offices.

This is a horrible hotel - it has multiple night clubs within the building with ZERO sound proofing. 

The entire building faces sound vibrations from 9.30 pm to 3.30 am when the clubs have music at full blast. You will not be able to sleep in any room.

Do NOT book room in this hotel - there are other options nearby for use during your visa interviews.

If you still need to stay here- the food is decent but the bathrooms are old/ not maintained properly.

Showing good gesture he offered me iron from the hotel but when i started ironing my shirt it spoiled it with black marks. 
When it comes to bed they were very uncomfortable and linen was smelly.
The next day i had to go out for few hours leaving my mom in the room. I passed by the reception and asked the boy if he can send something light to my room as my mom is not feeling well and she won't be able to come down for breakfast, he said its buffet but when i told him anyway m not having breakfast so you can send something light to the room, He gave positive response and said once breakfast is ready he ll do that but nothing happened till i came back around 3 Pm.

No restaurant in hotel, and the food is served in room and you have to eat the same on your bed. NO plates & cutlery is provided for eating food only after multiple reminder the same is sent.
The breakfast served is cold and the burners were not working.When i inquired for the same i was informed that they do not have chemical /oil and the same is exhausted and they could not source the same during my 3 day stay.

"The most horrific night ","1","2019-08","2019-09-09","I was visiting Kolkata for a conference and had booked Oyo Town House for a couple of nights. I checked in around 8:30 pm and went to sleep by 10ish, woke up at 11:30 pm to a nightmare, my arms had rashes and so did my face and leg, I realised it was something to do with the bed, called Reception, no one showed up for 15 minutes, later they sent a boy to change the bedsheet. I asked for the manager but there was none, called Oyo SOS, they said they would call a doctor which never arrived. In the midst of me losing my mind, they calling a doctor , the house keeping removed the bedsheet to realise the linens were dirty, the mattress topper had dust, hair, small tiny black things and so was the case with the inside of the duvet cover. It was the must disgusting sight, I asked them to move me to another hotel and they had to audacity to tell me contact Oyo, this is 1:30 am, no doctor, no fresh room and no manager onsite. The GM was on the phone with me and confessed that a doctor was never on his way and the staff had been manipulating me all this while.

The rooms are a good size, basic/minimalist and could do with improvements in hygiene. Perhaps an armchair or two in the rooms can make it more appealing. The front desk almost cancelled our booking despite confirming it and blamed it on the air conditioning not working rather than them doing a blunder with overbooking. There was no hot water - had to call the front desk more than 3 times for it. The staff could do with better training in housekeeping and general upkeep of the property.

Their service is pathetic. Hygiene levels are poor and they just don't clean the rooms and bathrooms well. The floors are sticky for some reason. There's no hot water to bathe until you call them up multiple times at the reception. Breakfast is unhygienic. Service is bad. Pathetic experience in this lovely city. We're a couple touring Calcutta and stayed here for 5 nights. There is no shelf to put the suitcase on. It's just a pathetic experience all together. They don't clean the rooms even after informing.

There were only a few staff when i checked in (probably because I checked in a bit late) and there was no one to escort me to my room and I had to search for my room on my own.
The buffet breakfast was pretty good. the spread was decent.
A shopping complex is located just opposite to this hotel which is fun to check out. There are a lot of areas of interest nearby.
The hotel has a nice night club though i did not spend much time there.

"Scarce parking, no proper smoking area, lovely food, avg meeting room","2","2016-12","2016-12-08","The best way to reach the place is to take a taxi from Exide crossing. We had been here in a business meeting for 2 days. The Picadilly 5 room was spacious but it had many issues like:-
1. AC not working frequently
2. Light intensity was very low
3. Chairs were very uncomfortable: not revolving type, no feet / headrest, small sized and heavy.
I did not like the concept of allowing public smoking within the main entrance gate and the reception entry point. Since the premises is not big, Smoking zones should be provided either at backside or prohibited within the premises so that non-smokers do not feel annoyed while walking into the hotel.
We were offered lunch and refreshments. Taste, menu, quality, quantity, hospitality etc were all very good and prompt. Utensils were clean but the napkins were very old and torn at many places. Another strange point: Forks were served only after being asked for. 
Parking for personal cars was a challenge for us as there are very few (5-7) slots in front of the hotel. Most of the times occupied by yellow board cabs.

The check in was smooth and very fast. the room (twin bed) was cozy with all amenities, wi fi was erratic though. The staff were helpful and knowledgeable but in the odd hours the promptness of the service dwindled, had to call 2-3 times for something basic done. the morning breakfast (complimentary) with room was served in the ground floor Piccadilly hall and was sumptuous and had variety from indian, south indian to continental delicacies, live eggs-to-order counter was fast and served with yummy cheese omlette. over all this is best for business travellers obviously if their trips are sponsored.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r425513941-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"450","38460474","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4a/dc/3a/drbhuvanjyoti.jpg","428","105","176","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drbhuvanjyoti","drbhuvanjyoti","06FDFD0B7B58205AC23098C4E7E6257B",,"662320","Ranchi, India","Ranchi","drbhuvanjyoti",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"great location and thats just about it","2","2016-09","2016-09-05","I had booked this hotel through their online service. I offered them my credit card so that i can use the room service. They said either I allow them to charge me an advance and then return any money left or i should pay cash. Every time i ordered, the waiter expected a cash payment. When i told him I am happy to pay at the end of my last order instead of every time - he panicked! The bar was being renovated and so was the dining hall.

"Almost Golden!","4","2016-03","2016-03-12","Recently on a business trip to Kolkata, I happen to stay at this Hotel Golden Parkk. Here is my feedback.

The Good
- Location: close to the business districts of Kolkata
- Spacious rooms, well furnished
- Clean and hygienic bathroom
- Decent Mattresses and Pillows 
- Food is quite good. Both Breakfast and Lunch were good. I would recommend the freshly made Dosas in the morning. Very well done indeed.
- Their concept of a welcome drink of a Pint of beer or 30ml of liquor was quite interesting and a welcome change from many hotels that over price alcohol.

The Bad:
- Overbearing service. Two times the guy knocked as I was eating my dinner. They need to give space to their clients
- Wi-Fi is pathetic. Got disconnected 10 times atleast.
- Guess the hotel was renovated in phases. It is a labyrinth of up/down/left/right turns in the hotel between meeting rooms and place where they serve lunch. They are maximising their space.
 
The Ugly
- Nothing that I can think of

Overall Verdict: Great place to stay. Go ahead.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r354933656-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452392144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","1200","68","104","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vishmon","Vishmon","8C685FAB39A9DF05D7B034FE7A940E87",,,,,"Vishmon",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"Comfortable Stay","3","2016-01","2016-02-01","The Hotel is centrally located and is in the off road. As this is a high raised building in a cluster of big buildings, not all the rooms have an outside view. The hotel lobby is spacious with the capsule lift moving up and down centrally.

"Golden service from Golden Parkk","4","2015-10","2015-10-15","We are regular customers of this hotel. And the hotel takes enough care to see that it stays that way. We have started taking many elements of their excellent service as taken for granted. Conducting one day meeting at another hotel reminded me the quality of service at Golden Parkk.
Everybody, from the bell boys, the servers in the banquet to the head of banquet knows and greets you personally. 
Although many of the halls can do with some renovation, the quality of service makes up for it.
Head of banquet services Mr. Subroto makes it a point to meet you at least once just to make sure that everything is going alright. Even their Director Ms Ramnik also visits if she is in town.
The food is very tasteful and sumptuous. Where most other hotels baulk if you ask for some small favorss like may be a cup of tea or an extra half hour, at Golden Parkk are delighted to oblige you.
The hotel may not be very glamorous or super luxury but their customer oriented service makes the meetings successful.
Only improvement I suggest is that they should investigate why in contrast to the rest of the hotel staff, the front office ladies are almost gruff and quite unfriendly!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r318872611-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"3072","115736029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/e5/fd/dd/supriyo-l.jpg","1728","68","656","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/supriyol","supriyo l","FD8FECC84D3EF4D6F493A42FAA3297BA",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","supriyol",,"General Manager","319237983","en","2015-10-16","Golden P","Dear Guest,

My booking had come to them 2 times via email and still the night I reached they had not managed to communicate with each other properly. Had to wait 20 mins at 1am for them to confirm that I can get a room.

Only if your work is near Chowringhee/Park street/US Consulate office in the same road,then you have an advantage over other hotel,otherwise it is not worth to stay here.

I actually did not stay here,but attended two back to back programs on two evenings at the banquet hall.Valet service is not good,they are upstart forgetting their salarys are paid through our money!

Nice looking small Reception and lobby once you go inside with glass paneled elevators will surprise you considering this is supposedly a budget business hotel.Overall clean ambiance.

Food is surprisingly good and their Fish batter fry was to die for.But again staff courtesy is not very good.The staff attending the buffet counter have a condescending tone without any apparent reason.

This hotel has a nice mall nearby apart from the proximity to Birla Planetarium,Maidan greens and Victoria Memorial

"Decent Stay","3","2015-01","2015-02-28","I stayed here while on a Business Trip to Kolkata. Its a normal hotel, but the best thing I liked was the Dinner recipes. Food (meals) was great, though Breakafst was very elementary. Housekeeping and Service was good. Wi-fi too was good. Location is also an advantage. People are helpful. The only thing that I feel was overrated was the website. I had asked for a Victorial memorial view. I was given a room which was a technically Victorai view. I say technically becuase you just get to see a a little of the top, as the view is totally blocked by plants. It was not definitely not a Victoria memorial view room. i would ahve appreciated if they would have told me that such a room was not available or given me a higher floor room","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r256928558-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"412","43503125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/97/ce/15/kunalbanerjee.jpg","550","119","2027","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KunalBanerjee","KunalBanerjee","EBB581CCFF6497DD388695C834F93029",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","KunalBanerjee",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"Not really Golden.. ","3","2014-10","2014-10-28","Stayed 2 nights here on an official trip. Yes, it's an old hotel with  basic amenities.. I found the room, washroom and the surroundings clean and comfortable. Majority of the guests are business travelers. 
Was indeed surprised to see that most of the staff were not only well trained but spoke pretty decent English. 
The buffet breakfast was not something to rave about in terms of the spread but the taste was decent. 
Was disappointed that the bengali cuisine was not available as their chef happened to be on leave. The continental menu is avoidable and the food that was served by room service had turned completely cold when it reached me. 
Surprisingly, though it's a business hotel they do not keep iron handy. Being a business hotel, such amenities are these days Considered basic and they should be provided. In the absence of an iron, I had requested the laundry dept to get my clothes ironed first thing in the morning as I had to leave for the meetings. However, there was no response to my call to pick the clothes and Noone turned up till even 8.15am. Finally when I was about to leave the bell boy landed up and was insisting that I get the laundry done now. Did mention my disappointment to the front desk to which the reply was a feeble.. 'oh I  am sorry....'  must mention that both during check in and check out felt that the receptionists at the front desk were unnecessarily curt to guests and very mechanical. 
Hence would say it was a so-so experience.

Rooms looked clean but I found few hair on bed. Also toilet was not properly clean.
I asked to clean room before I left for dinner. Later I found that toilet was clean but room wasn't. I called housekeeping which took long time to arrive.(Imagine it was 11:30PM and I was sleepy). Housekeeping staff refused to clean bed saying -""I can't do all work"". I lost my temper and threaten him to leave hotel. After that he changed my bedsheets. Breakfast was very poor quality. South Indian breakfast was cold and soggy.Sausages looked like their kitchen product. There was no verity in breakfast. on 2nd day I was pleased to see chicken nuggets as an option in breakfast. It ended in disappointment when I tested it. It was left over chicken wings,hard and dark in colour fried in red colour to hide dark colour.

"Stay Away!","2","2014-02","2014-03-12","Stayed at the Golden Park Kolkata after a gap of 8 years. Was there for 2 nights in Feb 2014 on a business trip. The booking was done by my company or I would never have opted for this property.

The problems started at check in. I asked for a King size bed, bud was told that they are all occupied. I was given a room with twin beds. Room 302 to be precise. I had checked in around midnight and went almost immediately to sleep. The was a loud hum and a vibration in the room. Thinking it was the airconditioning, I turned off the Ac but the noise continued. After enduring the noise for over 2 hours I finally called the reception. I was told that the noise was due to a generator below the room. Thankfully they agreed to change my room. So finally at 3 am i got another room, where thankfully the noise was much less and could finally sleep.

The Room: The hotel is over 2 decades old, and so are the rooms. Not been refurbished so far. The beds are rock hard as are the pillows. Extremely uncomfortable. to sleep on. The bathrooms too are of the by gone era. Room amenities are satisfatory.

Breakfast: Served in the basement. A bit dark and dingy room. Spread is extremely limited and none too great in taste either. Few tables packed rather closely and always over crowded. 

Lunch and dinner: Also served in the same basement. Limited menu at the buffet and rather awful in taste. Much rather just walk out and eat elsewhere.

Overall ambience: Nothing to speak of. Practically no parking space. Small lobby.
No health club, no swimming pool. There used to be a swimming pool around a decade back, but was filled in and converted into banquet rooms.

Sales Representatives hotel: Well this hotel has something like 14 banquet/conference rooms. Always booked by companies for their sales people. So there are teams of sales people all around.

Location: Not bad. Reasonably close to the business district and Park street.

Service: was the best part of the stay. Service is surprisingly good. 

Price: Really high given the standard of the hotel. I paid Rs 6000/-, that too corporate rate.

Overall a salesmens hotel. Nothing more.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r197132864-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"205","19432164","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/28/82/e4/doctorneel.jpg","215","71","157","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctorneel","Doctorneel","238DE4F08DB261C9A122DA535192D0D4",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","Doctorneel",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"Memorable Family Stay at The Lindsay Hotel, Kolkata! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","5","2025-05","2025-05-09","Our family trip to Kolkata was truly unforgettable, thanks to the wonderful experience we had at The Lindsay Hotel! From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warm smiles and prompt service that made us feel right at home.

You simply can’t beat the location—right in the heart of the city, just steps from the iconic New Market and close to major attractions like the Indian Museum, Victoria Memorial, and Park Street. We could walk to most places or easily hop onto nearby transport.

We stayed in a well-appointed family room that was both spacious and comfortable. The beds were cozy, the air-conditioning worked perfectly (a must in Kolkata!), and the room was always spotless thanks to the attentive housekeeping team.

The highlight for us was the Blue & Beyond rooftop restaurant—stunning city views, delicious food, and a peaceful atmosphere. We enjoyed both Indian and continental dishes, and the kids especially loved the desserts! 

The staff went above and beyond to make our stay special. Whether it was arranging transportation, helping with directions, or offering extra amenities for our children, their hospitality was truly five-star.

The hotel also features a small but well-equipped fitness area, reliable Wi-Fi, and excellent room service. We felt safe, well-cared for, and thoroughly relaxed.

The Lindsay is perfect for families looking for a central, clean, and friendly place to stay in Kolkata. It’s a great blend of comfort, convenience, and charm. We left with full hearts and plenty of memories—already looking forward to our next visit!

"Great Location, Excellent Staff","4","2025-04","2025-04-29","The Lindsay has a prime location with the swirl of Kolkata life just outside the secure door. I wanted to be nearer Eden Gardens to see IPL cricket and the choice was spot on. 

Staff are helpful and friendly.  My room had too much exposure to smoke and they moved me to  room with less smoke. Having non- smoking floors is something management may want to consider.  

The fabric of the building is aging and a little tired but everything works.  Good reliable wifi, attentive room services (I went out randomly according to my work but the room was always cleaned when I came back), generous supply of bottled water each day, a small refrigerator to keep water cold, an older but efficient shower with hot water, functioning elevators etc..  

I'd stay again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r1005176637-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452390706","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bibliotourist","Bibliotourist","5D3672D9514EA498C50BD04639D4DB67",,,,,"Bibliotourist",,"General Manager","1006967910","en","2025-05-12","The Lindsay","Dear Guest,

Greetings from O2 HOTELS, Kolkata.

Our sincere apology for the inconvenience You faced,

However on Your arrival You shared us with the Voucher No. of Booking.com instead You could have told Your name which is easier to recognize the Guest Concern booked through online. Voucher Numbers are long and is tough to remember.

Children upto 10 Years sharing the same room with the Parents and without extra bed is complimentary as per the policy, However in Your case a 12 Year Children is charged and is again as per the policy.
We have issued You the Bill of the amount You paid us for Extra Bed @ 799.00 + Tax so no question of returning the money arises because You have not paid us anything extra.

We will look into the matter with Booking.Com. why such discrepancy happened with the rate of Extra Bed so that we have better control as far Customer Service / Relation Development is concern 

We look forward to welcome You again @ HOTEL O2 OXYGEN and assure You our best services as always.

Thanks and Regards

"Good Place","4","2018-10","2018-11-07","Got a very good deal for the night and chose to stay over instead of driving across the city to my relative's place.
The Front Desk was very courteous and the check-in was brisk.. The only issue I had here that they and the security insisted that I leave my car keys with them which I refused. They accepted, BUT the front desk told the security at least 2-3 times my presence that he could go and knock my door at 2am/ 3am/ 4am whenever he required the keys. This was just trying to intimidate me, and was uncalled for. The car was parked as per their instructions in the designated area and wouldn't hamper anyone's movement at all.
Fine. They didnt require it at all.
The Rooms were quite functional and decent. Had a nice sleep after a long drive there.
The Breakfast was decent. If I'm in Kolkata and require to stay in that part of the city, I would definitely check-in here again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r631819881-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452389216","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg","1200","132","192","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abudhia","Ashish B","98D8C000BB809D9A9966A125FCE45AFD",,"662320","Ranchi, India","Ranchi","abudhia",,"Manager","713089631","en","2019-09-26","SUPRATIM B","Dear Sir,

I had to checkout early in the morning at 4:10 and hotel arranged for a quick morning snacks of veg sandwitch, muffins, banana and tea, cofee and packed juice which was very nice on hotels part. 

The checkout was quick and smooth. The hotel arranged drop to kolkata airport. It took 5 minutes to reach the airport. The hotel stay was satisfactory.

Check-in & check-out was super quick.. stayed at newly introduced B wing. rooms have efficient aircon. Flat tv, closet, 2 single seater sofa, tea coffee maker. Internet speed is average. You can request for smoking room. The bell boy was very polite and smiling. He seemed to be very excited for fifa match and enthusiastically switched on the match for me.
Minus points: bar closes at 11.15pm..I checked in at 11.30 and by the time I reached my room and placed request for a drink,  it was politely regretted. Tea coffee maker didn't have stirrer or spoon. 

Checkout was again super prompt.. Airport drop took me 5 min. 

Will recommend for a stay... didn't try the other facilities at hotel as my stay was for the wee hours only.

"Average, overpriced rooms","3","2025-01","2025-01-18","The hotel is running because of it’s location.The only thing I appreciated about my stay was that they arranged for an early check-in as requested. The rooms didn’t justify the prices charged. I had booked two rooms, one had a hard mattress and when I said about this at reception, the staff insisted that all their rooms have the best mattresses. The taps didn’t work properly in this room and the AC was for namesake. The housekeeping staff were polite, I really appreciate their hospitality. But the staff at the breakfast buffet had no sense of good service and the breakfast itself was way below average. The rooms were not very soundproof we could hear people talking in their rooms across the hall and it was disturbing.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r989756498-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452391513","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escape36922000288","Escape36922000288","0565549C4A42F6E3577E779FAB4F9C65",,,,,"Escape36922000288",,"Owner","992370278","en","2025-02-05","Nabamita Das","Dear Escape36922000288

"Worst, Depressive and Unpleasant stay","1","2024-11","2024-11-28","Worst, Depressive and Unpleasant stay at The Lindsay Kolkata from 21st Nov to 24th Nov 2024why-
1.) Quality of Room
Room quality is not up to the mark which they are showing on multiple websites. Size is too  small and you need to adjust your body to use the washrooms. The soap dispenser was not working and after complaints also not attended. Cleanliness is somewhat compromised. Don't know how this qualified for a 3 star hotel 
2.) Gunda or Rude behaviour of receptionist and Security guard
The hotel does not have car parking it's fine but they are looting the public if you want to park your car. I will tell my incident in brief over here-
I checked into the hotel on 21st Nov 2024. I had my  car which I parked in an unused place at night on a government road. The hotel staff told me that there is  chargeable underground parking here if you want to use it then you can use it at Rs. 500 per day then I said that in the early morning I will take my car and go to my work and again late night will come so it will work for me.
The next day they said that if you park outside on the road side then also you need to pay charges and they asked me to pay Rs. 1000. They asked me to pay the amount to the head of security guards and they were following me hard day and night and on the 23rd Night the receptionist called me at 11.45 in night to pay that Rs. 1000 and threatened me that if you will not pay than once you are outside the hotel then anything can happen with you. I replied okay let it be. So in summary they forgot all of our issues regarding room and soap dispenser and just focusing on their 1000 Rs. which does not belong to them and not sure they are going to keep with themselves or going to pay any third party.

It's my own experience which I faced on my stay booking ID  GH77247230327162. If you don't believe then stay and let's enjoy the behaviour of the staff and Room.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r982544862-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roam53280852980","Roam53280852980","7B214A2899D538FF41592F3334CEC904",,,,,"Roam53280852980",,"Owner","987461809","en","2025-01-02","Nabamita Das","Dear Roam53280852980

The runner on the bed was dirty. The fittings in the bathroom were old and semi rusted. Electricity went off twice with no battery back . Breakfast is charged at Rs 354 per person. We were charged Rs 3500 for the room for two of us with no  additional benefit. Except for the location, the price is far too high. They should not charge more than Rs 2000 per room per night. I had recommended this hotel to my cousin for day use and the hotel charged them Rs 4000 for two dirty rooms for about 10 hours usage.

My baby was facing difficulties to breath and made request to hotel reception to cancel my reservation and want to stay 1 night instead of 2. They refused and demand full-payment for 2 nights .

We were a family of four We 2 and our two daughters aged 10 and 13.When we reached the hotel at around 12 the manager Mr.Rocky was extremely rude to talk to, very unprofessional and had no feeling of hospitality. At that odd hour he made us wait at the reception and insisted on the ID's of all 4 to be duely signed.We all are world travevellers and never the children were asked to give their IDs and signatures at the time of hotel check-in.He even insisted to give full payment at that time without any bill. Both the children were charged at full price though the little one was sharing the bed with us. In short though the hotel is new and well maintained still we would never recommend anybody to go there because of such an unwelcoming attitude of the manager Mr.Rocky.

"Staying in the airport might be a better option","3","2016-11","2016-11-18","Trying to find something good to say about this hotel. Two things I came up with was that it was clean enough to have an overnight rest and it is near the airport.
We were off to a bad start before I even stepped into the hotel. My pick-up from the arrival was nowhere to be seen. I think he may have gone to the domestic terminal gates. My office had communicated many times to ensure that the pick-up will be there when I exit the terminal but alas! It was not to be.
After a call and some time of waiting, he finally came & we’re off to the hotel. We ran into a huge traffic jam just to get out of the airport area; many lanes converging to a few exit lanes. Good for me that the driver was able to weave in & out to get us out of there fast! If you can help it, stay at the airport to wait for your connecting flight. It’s not worth the hassle to get to the hotel and back. That’s why I cancelled my reservations for my return flight though I had to wait more than 7 hours for my connecting flight.
When I arrived at the hotel, I was not made to feel welcomed at all. The reception was professional AND cold. It was impossible to get a smile out of both the men at the counter. I tried again the next morning but to no avail. One would think that people in the service industry would be friendlier and smiley. Maybe the nightmare of the sudden announcement by the Indian government that 500 & 1,000 rupee notes are not valid anymore added to their woes!
If you stay here, please ensure that you booked the hotel with breakfast as there are no noteworthy places to eat around the hotel. So though the breakfast is rather mediocre, I’m thankful that I could at least have some toast and hard-boiled eggs.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r438268098-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"800","101928047","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/13/4c/6f/smkow.jpg","800","94","138","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smkow","sm","4BD58DE536DCADAC809779C0F6D77A70",,"294262","Singapore","Singapore","smkow",,"Front Office Manager","438526122","en","2016-11-19","SUPRATIM B","Dear Sir,

You stayed with us in HOTEL O2 VIP however Your comments were posted in HOTEL O2 OXYGEN,
My sincere apology to You for the inconvenience You faced due to the Airport Pick Up, actually on the day of Your arrival , parking zone of the Airport was full and it had a long Que , due to some VIP movement , so the driver could not park the car and tried to get in touch with You over phone as the Authorities never allowed us to park the car, which is beyond our control at times in case of VIP movement or emergency.
 
Your reservation with us was for DELUXE DOUBLE ROOM and the size is up to satisfaction , however it seems You wanted some bigger size rooms maybe SUPER DELUXE or SUIT and as we were sold out that day we could not upgrade Your room but I promise You on Your next visit will give You a bigger room to make Your stay more comfortable and convenient.
I will also request You to try our Premium Property HOTEL O2 OXYGEN , Kolkata on Your next visit and assure You our best services as always,

We look forward to serve to again at O2 HOTELS,Kolkata

"Budget friendly  hotel in close proximity to  the  Kolkata airport.","3","2016-05","2016-05-28","For all those weary travellers who need to hop on and hop off the flight there could be no better option than this Hotel located on VIP Road   just a few minutes ride from Kolkata Airport.
The rooms are decent and so are the  mattresses.The room may not be big enough but for the short stay and the  logistical advantages  it scores over the other  hotels.The  lounge is good and the typical bengali preparations are good.
The toilets are clean .The lift is a bit ""too"" compact. The passages are dimly lit  but the windows in the room  fill it with the  natural light.
The aircon  works fantastic .
The rooms  have the charging point which  are far away from the bed. so your phone charges away from you when u are in the bed.But does it really matter?

The  biggest  plus is the close proximity to the airport, accessible within  minutes by a cab.What more could you expect in  the beaming metropolis  of India where the chances of getting  stuck up in the traffic is remote if O2 gives you that advantage !!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r377475165-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452387615","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg","1200","3","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dryogesh","dryogesh","24B37AD42E9B4625E123FE3BEB1539E4",,,,,"dryogesh",,"Front Office Manager","378221497","en","2016-05-31","SUPRATIM B","Dear Sir,

"A close hotel to Airport","4","2016-04","2016-05-14","We stayed at this hotel for just 1 night before we could catch our flight next day morning. This hotel is decent and very near to the Airport, you can reach this hotel by taxi within 5-10 minutes from airport which is an added advantage. The downsize is that not all taxi will be willing to make a trip to hotel as the distance is short and you may end up paying a bit more. Rooms at the hotel are not too big. The bathroom is little small as well. The hotel rooms had centralized AC, we did face challenges with airflow in room due to the placement of AC vents in the room. It did make the room little hot & stuffy. People as reception were friendly and helped us check in within very little time though we checked in at the hotel very late around 2 AM in the morning.  The hotel serves buffet breakfast in the morning, the choice of spread for breakfast and quality of food was good. The good thing was the breakfast was ready by 7.00 AM in the morning with all dishes placed. This will really help travelers to grab a quick breakfast before they can catch their flight. On the price this hotel is definitely expensive. You can opt for this hotel if you are really short of time and want to stay very close to airport.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r372787611-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"683","323337517","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/45/bd/2d/sujirmurlidhar.jpg","683","19","76","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SujirMurlidhar","Murlidhar Nayak","F5C35572DE7D5B86CA4BF2DD2D2B6C6E",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","SujirMurlidhar",,"Front Office Manager","378219429","en","2016-05-31","SUPRATIM B","Dear Sir,

"Stay only for location.","3","2015-05","2016-04-22","I stayed at O2 for a night while returning from Guwahati  . I had to catch early morning flight and this hotel was one of the nearest to Airport hence I booked here and stayed overnight.

The room size was small and the interior was not impressive. The paint work was going on and the room has strong paint odour which I am allergic to. I requested the reception to change the room but they denied stating that no other room was vacant  . It was difficult staying there  however I managed to stay as I had no option. 

The airconditioner was working well and room had TV too. 

The bathroom was poorly maintained and shower area was straggly designed behind a column. I checked out early morning . It took hardly ten minutes to reach to Airport from here.  I hired a normal cab as drop charges of hotel was quite high.the hotel also offers complimentary breakfast which I couldn't try as I checkout early.

Overall a very average experience staying here.  There are better options near airport.  Stay here only for the location.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r366499885-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"533","328650637","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/96/cf/8d/pankaj-b.jpg","533","155","1356","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PankajBajpai","PankajBajpai","B2120B25C06986CEDF3C41DE9AD05BA6",,"297595","Raipur, India","Raipur","PankajBajpai",,"Front Office Manager","378217793","en","2016-05-31","SUPRATIM B","Dear Sir,

The staff was responsive and helpful. The rooms are clean with good ambiance. Before reaching I booked Premium Super deluxe in advance but after checking-in and see the room the space was not so convenience as show in website. However i have upgraded my room to Premium Suite. I should thank the gentlemen Mr. Subhradeep for the flexibility provided in upgrading my room. The suite rooms are located on the road side, there is little disturbance from the traffic however i wish to compromise on the space for my daughter to play. Food was good. Amenities are provided as mentioned. I recommend families to choose suite rooms if you have money to pay. Had done lots of shopping in City Center mall which is very close and also in New market though it is very rush. There was a delay in my pickup which i was not so happy.

"Amazing Experience- O2 Oxygen","5","2016-02","2016-03-20","First of all, I would like to thank Goibibo for giving a whopping discount on booking. Now coming on to the hotel O2 Oxygen, it is located very near to the Airport on the VIP road. The rooms are strategically built with ample space and well decorated. The hotel staffs are very courteous.
The first instance which has created a good impression about the hotel is the Manager's response about any enquiry for an early check in. I requested for an early check in and he responded immediately over the mail. This positive gesture has really won my heart and I would like to stay again in O2 in my future trip.
 The only cons about the hotel which I found is the overly priced food but nonetheless the food was tasty","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r356953335-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1500","419092476","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/fa/d7/fc/shiv0123.jpg","1500","30","244","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shiv0123","Shiv0123","35793BB708019007F68EF06B770E7F37",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","Shiv0123",,"Manager","361442724","en","2016-04-04","SUPRATIM B","Dear Sir,

"Don't expect anything great !","3","2013-10","2013-12-16","This is a very regular business hotel, and because of its location is able to charge a premium. Else this would qualify as a budget hotel.

The rooms are just ok, and everything in the hotel seems old and falling apart. The place is not very clean but one can live with it. The rooms are small and just liveable. Food is below average and I would recommend that one should eat outside. There are some great restaurants in Kolkata as well as near to the hotel. Service is poor to mediocre. A big problem with this hotel is that it hosts large number of events and conferences for various companies and these are day events. Hence the place can be very noisy both in the day and night.

Not recommended for families and if you plan to have a relaxing time. If are a part of the conference well then with company the place anyways becomes secondary. Those who plan to drive to the place, please note the place has no great parking facilities and the road outside can be very loud and jammed during peak hours.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r187845947-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"412","47263374","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/d1/2e/8e/anirudh-g.jpg","550","134","175","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnirudhG","Anirudh G","35F4E3872E9DB2E51C7418456D8D502D",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","AnirudhG",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

- the front desk staff was pretty callus to be fit for any hospitality job
- mattress was damp and crushed to its minimum possible thickness
- there were two AC's in room. split unit and central AC. since the climate was cool i turned both AC's OFF, but the central AC unit didn't oblige at all. i almost froze overnight.
- no iron/iron board
- on tv almost none of the channels were subscribed/paid for

This is despite the fact that the booking was done from our company under corporate and with discount!! when I enquired if this was the procedure even for any one coming to the hotel on personal visit their answer was affirmative... Strange ... very strange.. And the staff had not even a slightest embarrassment on their face when I asked this uncomfortable question....

The reception staff was horrible... No manners.. No etiquettes. they did not even seem from Hospitality Industry and that to from Front Desk!!!  There body language showed as if they are obliging us allowing them to stay in their hotel and as if we were staying there for free....I had a feeling of typical ""Culture"" from their behaviour. Slow speed of working.. Pathetic style.. careless attitude..

Nothing else is worth writing.. Location and entry is depressing and unsafe.. staff non-cooperative, facilities below standard... 

Food was average as we had dinner that night. Restaurant staff was slightly better...

Overall rating poor however with grace can be elevated to Average.. waste of money wouldn't recommend to anyone...","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r162305936-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452387345","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg","1200","12","15","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guy072","guy072","1945D25AAECCD3E7589224EA13E930C6",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","guy072",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

I made a few calls and decided to go to Golden Park Calcutta. Strangely, the entrance is off the main road, a little obscure! The moment i entered I thought I was somewhere down south - so typical of the southern hotels was the small lobby-foyer. The room was ok, but the breakfast was a let down- the breakfact area was almost dingy place. Or maybe I have been papmered bad by better experience. Maybe because of this a lone I will not repeat the place.

"Excellent location!!","4","2013-01","2013-03-09","This property is a classic mid-size business hotel in the heart of Kolkata. It is located close to many historic locations, central markets and places of interest.

Let me also say this at the outset- this is a pure business hotel that host conferences, pretty much, on a daily basis so if you are thinking of a quiet family time at a hotel then this may not be the place for you. This hotel is great for staying at a central point, going out there in the city during the day time, and coming back for sleep only. 

The hotel rooms are alright for a business hotel. The food at the restaurant is good, and the kitchen staff is happy to accommodate your special requests as well. The staff is well informed about local attractions and places. 

All in all, this hotel knows how to take care of their guests with all the limitations. There can be many improvements that I can suggest such as noise control during parties and conferences and proper cleaning in rooms.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r154091901-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452388198","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","86","95","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TouringBuffalo","Legal E","762B7432C53BA322A6D9E33C885F94DD",,"1584804","Mohali, India","Mohali","TouringBuffalo",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"Basking in Demand-Supply Gap","3","2013-01","2013-01-21","The only good point about this hotel is its location. Quite strategically located behind Tata Centre and in close vicinity of some of the major offices. This always keeps it in strong demand and they generally run overbooked 365 days a year. So when they anticipate a peak in demand due to upcoming conference or meets, they just like any opportunist hike its rates. 

Quite naturally Service Orientation is not on its radar as they are not starved for customers. There restaurant for breakfast is very very basic and so is the menu. You can expect better breakfasts in some of the Guest Houses in Kolkata. They do have a club (discotheque) which can be avoided. Very empty on weekdays and lewd on weekends. 

Room sizes are good and cleanliness average (You might find torn bed-sheets), All in all can ok for overnight in-transit stay... but not at all value-for-money.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r150201420-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452361217","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg","1200","24","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ViXXiV","ViXXiV","312136498C1F99E018A7BC4524A77F92",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","ViXXiV",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"Nice property, staff does not care","3","2020-03","2020-03-10","This was  a stay for a short work trip (4 nights),  and I felt they could improve a lot.  They have a lovely old world charm 
Pros: 
Central location, near New Market
Beautiful property, old world charm, some rooms have large windows
Great food, even simple room service food is spectacular
Nice roof top restaurant

Cons: 
Staff seems to have lost interest, simply dont care. 
I was served soup in a dirty infected bowl (see pic). All I got was a sorry, next morning the manager acted as if its no big deal. Was not offered a refund, was charged in full. 
My colleague who is 6 feet 4 inches tall,  asked thrice for his two beds to be joined. On the third night, he actually begged, before the staff paid any heed. 
Rooms are not cleaned well. Cockroaches in the bathroom are a common site
They shamelessly charge you for extra tea and coffee sachets, that too RS 10 per sachet!! Someone please tell them that coffee sachets costs about Rs 2 and tea is Ra 5. 
Staff is rude to a point, they a single lady traveler is not helped to carry her luggage to her car, parked less than 100 meters away. 

I don't recommend, unless the staff and management wakes up. Sadly might have to stay there again, as my company travel agent books with them.

"The hotel area is overcrowded","1","2020-01","2020-01-21","It is situated in a very commercial market area. It is even very difficult to figure out the location. There is no hotel like feeling in the entrance. It is just in the midway of a market. It may be good for sole business visits, otherwise not preferable for family with children. Rooms are old but its okay. The housekeeping and complementary breakfast are satisfactory. The good part is that it is adjacent to famous Hoggs market which is crowded all the time. The price is bit overrated.

At almost one hundred dollars a night this place is absurd. No compensation for no hot water - just more charges to upgrade to another junk room. Stay away!

"'ALL OUR ROOMS ARE SMOKING ROOMS! - Beware!","3","2012-11","2012-12-04","GOLDEN PARKK, KOLKATA, INDIA

NOV 21, 2012

This appears to be a fine property that was started with all the best ideas but then ran out of steam/inspiration. I was frankly puzzled why this great looking property is not run better!

Positives

1	Great location, if you have business in the area and/or want to workout, as I did, in the relatively clean air near abouts the Victoria Memorial Hall. There is a small but extremely clean place called 'Mohor Kunj' opposite the Planetarium, that is very nice and free.

2.   	Inside nicely done, room furnishings very nice, bathroom well done, good water pressure, plenty hot water; linen not so fresh, a little grungy. Ample towels, good and plentiful toiletries. I am a sucker for green Marble!

3.	Great restaurant! Deep Menu, tasty and fresh stuff. Stay away from the Buffet though, as I should have done :( ; those serving spoons spread bad hygiene like wild fire; the GI distress hit me half way between Dubai and SFO. Food ordered from the Menu were superb. The personnel were attentive and well groomed. I would patronize the restaurant even if I were staying elsewhere!

Negatives	

1	The Reception personnel need to be sharper and trimmer; nothing a little training and reduced 'carb' diet won't fix! Also they need not be so curious about a guest's Passport as to check out every page, as if reading a book! I have not noticed this degree of interest in a guest's Passport anywhere else! Just make a freaking copy and hand it back. Very un-professional, IMHO!

Also why not organize your reception like most other Hotels? Have your check-in clerks stand up behind a podium, while greeting guests; as a guest checking-in, I do NOT want to sit down; its not like filling in a form for opening a bank checking account! Just one signature, hand over the key and away you go! 

2.	Made me pay for the room in advance; while checking-in! Now, where in the world in a respectable Hotel, does one pay in advance while checking in? Creates a very bad impression! 

3.	All rooms are SMOKING rooms! The woman at the desk told me so right away; I had specifically and emphatically asked for a non-smoking room; it is a deal breaker for me. No where in the web site does it say that 'There are no non-smoking rooms'! It should, so as to not mis-lead Customers. Again, a nice property such as this, needs to stomp out smoking everywhere, including the front entrance. Pretty disgusting to see people lining up outside the front door, puffing away! My room was sprayed heavily with freshener, when I checked in; by the morning the spray had worn off and the room smelled like an ashtray; spent the rest of the day in the restaurant, which is, 'thank god', non-smoking. 

4. The front drive thru of the Hotel is jammed with cars, all day! Now this is a fire/safety/security hazard of gigantic proportions! Get them cars outta there and find other parking facilities. Again, it bears repeating, such a nice property with much potential, has these glaring faults, its mind boggling.

5	There was one hidden charge on checkout, for using the internet for reservation! Trifle amount, but such charges create a very bad impression. Say it out loud up front; people do not mind paying, they hate being blind sided!

6	Web site needs work; many spelling mistakes; the word 'complement' was used many times where clearly 'compliment' was intended. Come on, Indian folks have good command over the language, don't they?!

Final Thoughts

	Great property; need some 'whipping into shape' type work! Also, in my book, absence of non-smoking rooms, is a deal breaker. 

Hope this review is constructive and helpful.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r146788576-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452386535","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","1200","5","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaliG931","Kali G","BE1E2D68672B084D596613933A3F14D5",,"33146","Sunnyvale, California","Sunnyvale","KaliG931",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"
"Not a happy experience! Beware hotel bookings on agoda!","2","2012-11","2012-11-24","Had a confirmed booking on agoda for this hotel. When I reached the hotel, they refused to accept my booking as they said agoda had not confirmed the booking with them. I tried calling agoda (whose helpline no is in the U.S). Got cut off every time a customer care executive came on the phone. Finally got my office to call then. They suggested an alternate hotel as they said the hotel did not have a room. When I informed them that the hotel did indeed have a room, they got back saying that the hotel will honor the voucher. I checked with the hotel and they did confirm that the voucher will be accepted. 

This was not the end of it. While checking out I was presented with a bill towards the tariff of the room. When I asked them why this was done they informed me that in the evening agoda had called them and told them that they will not honor the voucher. I asked for the email from agoda which they were not able to provide me. After constant back and forth they finally accepted the voucher and I checked out. 

As far as the hotel is concerned it is centrally located. The rooms are small but adequate. The breakfast is average. I happened to be on the second level. The other guests were extremely noisy till very late in the night. 

All in all an overpriced, well located hotel which I hope I do not have to stay in again!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r146118070-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,,,,,"1","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinadvani","Dinesh","953C90C4CFDD72667595844E84EA75F2",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","dinadvani",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

For me it save an hours commute opposed to staying in a western flagged hotel and the rooms are are clean and the flood is safe.

"Ideal hotel for business trips","4","2012-06","2012-06-26","The first advantage of this hotel is its location. Located at just back side of Tata Center, all sorts of transports are always available, it is also not far off from park street, which is full of good restaurants & centre of city's night life.
The room was decent & specious, but the mattress was bit hard & was causing bit discomfort. The major problem was that toilet was not fitted with a hand faucet & one had to use bucket & mug, if required.
Varity was less in the breakfast spread, but food was good. Like other 3 star hotels, food was costly, so I mostly tried the good restaurants of Park strret, which was nearby.
Overall look of the hotel was impressive, fitted with two, big, capsule lifts & service was also very prompt. I liked check in & out, as it took only 2 minutes each time.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r132796680-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"412","42903023","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/8e/a5/ef/pijush.jpg","550","28","58","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pijush","Pijush","D10C63CAB40727EFD7955375B97600CD",,,,,"Pijush",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"
"Very good central hotel","4","2012-05","2012-05-31","I was traveling with my family to Kolkata for the first time. Was little apprehensive as not heard good things about safety/professionalism of Kolkata. This hotel was booked by a friend. Let me jot down the +ves of this hotel :

1. Centrally located (all major shopping/eating areas were walking distance)
2.Very safe (in fact the hotel is located between the US and UK consulates). So lot of police on the road.
3. Very good and wholesome buffet breakfast (which runs from 7 am to 10.30 am)
4. Helpful and friendly staff 
5. Easy check in procedure and in fact they gave us late checkout which really worked for us as a family
6. Do go for a early morning walk at the beautiful Victoria Memorial which is very close by.

Highly recommended !","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r131022901-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"412","31823952","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e5/98/50/atul102.jpg","550","23","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atul102","Atul102","83CEC2E2FCBC911E79F22742E21A839C",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","Atul102",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

Positives : 
Great location, bang in the middle of the city with close proximity to the Victoria Memorial, the shopping area and the metro.
The rooms are decently large and decently maintained.
Food is palatable and fairly reasonable
The hotel staff are very friendly. Right from the reception to the waiters in the restaurant to the staff handling the conferences, everyone goes out of the way to help
Have got over 7 large halls for conferences.

Negatives : 
The rooms could have been maintained better.
Given the number of conferences you have a lot of people, not necessarily hotel guests, in the lobby and conference areas giving the hotel a crowded look.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r121118303-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"724","127520094","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/99/cd/5e/shara-11.jpg","724","54","144","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shara_11","Sharad","6E2236EDB9FDF0F78E4870AAB49D070C",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","Shara_11",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

Overall, the room service experience was satisfactory. The staff was generally polite and efficient in taking orders. However, there were a few areas where improvements could be made:
Positives:
 * Prompt service: Orders were delivered within a reasonable timeframe.
 * Pleasant staff: The room service attendants were courteous and helpful.
Areas for Improvement:
 * Food quality: The quality of the food could be enhanced, particularly in terms of flavor and presentation.
 * Menu variety: A wider range of options, especially for dietary restrictions and preferences, would be appreciated.
 * Packaging: The packaging of food items could be more eco-friendly and less wasteful.
 * Attention to detail: Small details, such as ensuring correct orders and providing necessary utensils, can significantly impact the overall experience.
By addressing these areas, the room service experience can be elevated to provide guests with a truly exceptional dining experience.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1438191-r978347840-Indismart_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452389795","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer22522902216","Flyer22522902216","C8FF768ED0BF16221F79B2925C67D4FD",,,,,"Flyer22522902216",,"Revenue Management","978602420","en","2024-11-03","Koustav Singha","Dear Guest,

The location is great near to some good restaurant and in a calm serenity. The communication is great from this place. The check in super fast and as for the check out. The rooms are good sized and with all the required amenities. The food was good, but the breakfast spread was forgettable. The place is over staffed and thus sometime becomes a bit hard to communicate. The person who checked me out was super cool( sorry forgot his name) packed breakfast for us and when he came to know that our flight is delayed, offered us room again for us to stay back. Super gesture :). The staff every where were so good and welcoming. Felt so great about the stay.

"Clean, decent 3 to 4 star place.","4","2015-09","2015-11-07","Stayed at the O2 while on an late night stopover at Kolkatta airport. Its less than a 10 minute taxi ride from the airport. There are two O2 hotels side by side - 'O2 'and then the 'O2VIP'. Apparently there must quite a bit of confusion among the guests, coz the hotel security kept my taxi waiting until I had confirmed my stay at the O2.
Location: By the side of a 4 lane busy road. 
External appearence - Rather poor by international standards; But pretty OK inside.
Rooms and amenities: Rooms are good, modern (looks recently refurbished) adequately sized, with quality fittings esp in the bathrooms;  Good wifi, sofas, writing desk and flat screen TV. Sleep was comfortable.

"Mediocre","3","2015-07","2015-08-26","I was travelling by myself, first time in India, booked this hotel for the first night. The descriptions online did not match the hotel exactly but I was just glad to have a bed. 
Rooms were spacious and clean, staff was very, very, very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the wifi did not work which was somewhat unlucky for me because I was travelling alone and had many people waiting for a response from me! The manager was trying to help me all night, unfortunately it didn't work but thank you so much for trying!
The room had only windows in a tiny, dirty courtyard, which first I thought was good/ no noise from the streets BUT at 4 in the morning there was very loud hare krishna music coming from outside (obnoxiously loud) which lasted for 4 hours and was a bit exhausting to me.
Food was really good, enjoyed breakfast and newspaper. 
All in all, it was a little expensive for my taste and what expected me there but the staff was exceptionally nice!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r303932554-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452388586","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","1200","27","64","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annamk1212","Annamk1212","D1BAF439D81B3B1135F4740BF6A262AB",,"190454","Vienna, Austria","Vienna","Annamk1212",,"Front Office Manager","305746699","en","2015-09-01","SUPRATIM B","Our Sincere gratitude and heartiest thanks to You for choosing Our Hotel.

"Nice place to stay on budget","4","2015-07","2015-08-22","I got a great deal for this hotel while looking for hotels near Kolkata airport on a booking portal and was very satisfied with the hotel. The room was very clean, the bed neat, the bathroom and toiletries were just the way I liked. They serve complimentary breakfast and it was decent too. The hotel's proximity to airport is an advantage for those planning to make a pit stop in this city.

The wifi didn't however work the two nights I stayed here and I was told they were facing some technical problems.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r302187373-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"602","123044684","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/55/83/4c/unimorphic.jpg","602","14","48","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unimorphic","unimorphic","514874BCB853A303A5810A4D347B44A9",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","unimorphic",,"Front Office Manager","303602604","en","2015-08-26","SUPRATIM B","Dear Sir,

Bad part would be that there is no 24 hours kitchen, as we ordered something for our kid for take away at around 11.30am before leaving but were told that chef will be available only from 12pm although the items from breakfast were available.

"Parkk or Park?","3","2011-09","2011-09-30","While pondering the question, one can also admire the opulent lobby of this rather chunky looking hotel at the historic Ho Chi Minh street of the city.
The rooms are claimed to have a boutique look but this seems to be restricted to rather garish primary colors.
The rooms at the rear overlook a large vacant lot while those at the front face the street.
Hotel Golden Park (it has a second ""k"" by the way)is also known for its huge, cavernous disco lounge bar restaurant which is supposedly filled up at weekends. There are also nearly 14 conference rooms, banquet halls and meeting rooms which explains the frequent movement of groups of people in the breaks around the hotel.
Food is of an acceptable standard as it is generally in most hotels here.
The location of the hotel is central for the historic quarter and with the UK Deputy High Commission and the U.S. Consulate round the corner security should not be a concern.
Basically attractive to the business traveler large family groups were also seen frequenting the hotel ahead of the holday season.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r118773012-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"436","456439598","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/34/b7/2e/shivaparvati.jpg","436","256","1009","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShivaParvati","Ardhanareeshvara","DB4B797BFCEC8D9F0006325821DB26B2",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","ShivaParvati",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

Rooms are not very roomy or plush, but you can't expect much for this price range.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r106618744-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"450","28727750","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b6/59/c6/the-0ne.jpg","298","49","59","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_0ne","the_0ne","C17824E48A0A6A4927CE1432E4992F74",,"60763","New York City, New York","New York City","the_0ne",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"Hotel Golden Park, Kolkata - an example of day by day Deteriorated Service & Standard","3","2010-02","2010-06-29","Located around a kilometer away from the Victoria Memorial and the Maidan, this hotel is basically meant for business travelers. It is in the centre of the city and opposite to Metro Plaza - a shopping mall.

I stayed in this hotel many times. First I stayed in February 2004 and afterwards many times. But unfortunately over these years I have observed a continuous downfall in the service and standard of this hotel. When for the first time I stayed in this hotel I was really enjoyed my stay there. Good location, good room, good food, good service – everything was excellent. I in fact was delighted to have such a kind good hotel in the centre of Kolkata as I require traveling frequently to this city on business as well as personal works. But to my dismay, day by day I discovered a sharp deterioration in their service and standard. The most noticeable factor was the attitude of the staffs; starting from door keeper to reception and service staff – they all work but no smiling, professionalism or welcoming attitude reflects. Porters, room boy, housekeeping staff – all are after tips in an indecent manner. 

Though outside view is not so good, inside the hotel it is beautiful. A small lobby space, modern lift, touch of Egyptian art in the lobby & common space and painting works in room corridor areas. As far room is concerned it is good and comfortable. They provide complementary cookies and chocolate in the room which is a good part of their service. Toilet amenities provided are basic though early days there used to be some more high quality varieties. Shampoo and moisturizer given there not suitable to use. Last time I found towel smelly. Dirty water from toilet tap is a regular phenomenon.  

During our stays in the year 2004 to 2006, there used to be delicious varieties in buffet menu but during last few stays I found it degraded by one third in terms of varieties. 

My last stay there in the month of February for 2 nights on the way to Mumbai. In the last night I could not sleep properly as a late night party was going on; drum bits coming from there were very much disturbing. The music and dance floor was sound-proof. The following day I had the early morning flight for Mumbai and requested the staff and manager in-charge to do the needful so that I could have a sound slip but they did nothing other than expressing their apologies. At around 2:30 am the party was over and I managed a short nap till 4 am, then rushed for airport. 

What seems to me is lack of professionalism and proper management causing this hotel towards deterioration. Since it has many positive factors, the hotel can be turned into first class business standard hotel if total management and staff of the hotel can be changed.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r69125433-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"412","24184162","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/71/05/62/travelpagla.jpg","550","63","50","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilesAndMemories","MilesAndMemories","E46966C7B769D1DBA3E7D1E51981F23E",,,,,"MilesAndMemories",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"Average hotel. Economical. Budget hotel","3","2009-03","2010-05-13","service experienced : absolutely average. some of the staff smell as though they have just come out of a cigarette factory. Speaking to the staff means taking a huge dose of secondary smoke. in the evening the staff may not be there. 

how you liked the room : Average rooms. a/c's old style - window a/c's. Rooms are small. the initial stairs are wooden type. lift is capsule and when i checked in - was non - functional. :-( my luck.

location & amenities : more or less, centrally placed. amenities provided are basic. running water - yes. but if you intend to collect it in the bucket, you would be surprised to see the colour. you dont get a shaving kit here, nor a dental kit. ask for it and it comes as though they have done the biggest favour in your life for you.

liked best & least : its a budget hotel. so its light on your pocket. service is something like - pay more get more. simple.

"Beware of checking out scam","3","2010-01","2010-01-12","This hotel is conveniently situated but not cheap at 2000 rupies per night plus luxury tax.  Room service has 10% service charge.  All this was fine and we stayed for five nights.  At no stage were we offered clean towels - my daughter and I had one towel between us for the five nights.  Housekeeping rarely answered the telephone.  When we called room service, a tip was expected (despite the 10% service charge) and we payed as we ordered in order to avoid disputed extra additions at the end.  During the first three days we tipped but when we started getting the wrong change back - i.e. fifty rupies less and then grumpy apologies when I questioned the change, we stopped tipping.  We started not getting change unless I demanded it.  They always rounded up to the nearest ten but rounding up to the nearest hundred was a bit much.

  I paid in advance for the accommodation asking exactly what the final cost for the room including all taxes would be so that they didn't come up with something new at the end.

However, when we went to check out, we were asked to pay 200 rs for the ""damaged towel"".  The grey, brown ""white"" towel had dropped on the bathroom floor and so was dirty (two people had used it in dusty Kolkata for five days at a ""luxury"" hotel.  I was furious and asked for a bucket of water and soap as it would take three minutes to wash it.  However, I was told that the towel was too damaged now to be used again so I must pay for a new one.  I suspect I was not the only victim of this scam as often we had heard loud abusive screaming in the mornings which I realised must have been other people checking out and facing the same scam.  Also, they had all the room service boys and several staff at receptiion all demanding the 200rs in a group.  Hardly a pleasant exit to what would have been a reasonable stay.  It left a very bitter taste in my mouth and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d308401-r53262482-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452389422","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","1200","46","40","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacancer","vacancer","E20C79C0E97B9228C3B5C3C7CB591C8C",,,,,"vacancer",,,,,,,,"13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700071 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700071","West Bengal","13 Ho Chi Minh Sarani",,"308401","22.547663","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.34957","The Golden Parkk Hotel","172","3.5","13","14","51","61","33","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d308401-Reviews-The_Golden_Parkk_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://www.goldenparkk.com/"

"Don't expect fancy, but quite a nice place","4","2005-12","2006-06-11","I've traveled to India (Kolkata/Calcutta, specifically) since I was a little girl, and I can tell you that this place exceeded all my expectations for Kolkata and even India. While it may not measure up to the expectations of wealthy spoiled Americans, it is quite reasonable for anyone who has grown up middle class in developed nations, students just out of college or even hardy older travellers. My husband and I relaxed in the room after a flight from Delhi and enjoyed tea and cookies in our room. My biggest fear, the plumbing, was entirely unfounded because the shower in this hotel was the BEST of all the hotel showers in India I tried (the worst perhaps in Goa). The toilet flushed fine, the room was clean and contrary to the review above, I did not smell anything bad or detect a mildew problem (I read the review before I went and almost changed my reservation, thank goodness we didn't). The staff was very courteous and even the downstairs restaurant.was reasonable. I didn't have any problems with this place at all and think it's fine for travellers who need a clean place to stay.

"Avoid it, spend a little more","2",,"2005-04-19","I stayed there November 2004-booked through Travelocity. Price was very reasonable USD 58 per night. Based on the price I expected it to be mid range hotel-something like Holiday Inn in USA. But I was wrong. This hotel need major work-specially in some rooms. I felt this hotel is very old and I could smell it in the air. Furniture, beds, curtains everything was old and smelly. We rented 2 rooms for 3 days, one of the room smelled very bad-smell of mild dew, dust, rotten woods etc. I had my room changed but the other room was as stinky as the first one. Ac went out oneday and TV on another day. On both occation 3/4 repair staff were send to the room the problems were fixed. The staffs are no doubt friendly but there is only so much they can do. One the 3rd day I got really sick. If you are from the west I strongly suggest you choose one of those 5 star hotel like Oberoi Grand or Taj Bengal instead of trying to save a few bucks like me. The city Kolkata is very hot and humid  in the daytime with no ac in the cabs-at night you desperately need a cool, fresh and comfortable room to get some sleep.

The staff is extremely courteous and friendly, restaurant serves good food and the room has everything you need.
This is the only hotel I have come across having security on EVERY floor. Special thanks to Abhishek Majumdar, Deboshish Mandal and Tafeem  for proper guide on the city and making my stay very comfortable.

Just a small suggestion - would request the hotel to have a 'doctor on call' facility in case the guest faces any medical concern on visit. 

Overall Totally worth it, I'll definitely be staying here everytime I visit Calcutta.

"Horrible experience","1","2019-05","2019-05-16","We booked the hotel as a stopover coz we saw nice reviews about the place. But we were sadly mistaken. We reached early and were made to wait for one and half hours before we were appointed a room. The reception staff were unhelpful to the last bit. On being informed that we had requested an early check-in the day before they asked us to show the voice recording of the msg. When we finally got the room we had to stumble around searching for it because no one bothered to show us. Entering the room was another nightmare. The furniture was chopped and the room was shabby as it gets. Bathroom was also dirty and we decided to checkout. On being told we are checking out the reception guy asked if we needed a bill. I mean if you are not refunding the amount and we are not staying also why the hell will we not require a bill. It was a traumatic experience to say the least. Luckily we found a place to stay if only by paying twice the amount because of the nightmare called indismart hotel. Wouldn't recommend anyone to stay .","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1438191-r674494179-Indismart_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JediInHeels","Sreepurn","93679583B3D2254104A3035A74F74A3A",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","JediInHeels",,"Front Office Manager","681141562","en","2019-06-12","HOTELINDISMART","Dear Guest,

We always honor a guest and their feedback but till that point it is genuine. First of all, you charged and forced the staff at the reception for giving you a room as early checkin by falsely claiming of a telephonic conversation that had happened on the previous day. We had no room to offer on that day for early check in and on requesting you to produce the recording of the conversation which you had claimed, you failed to produce the proof of the discussion. You were given a superior room which we have given to many guests ( corporate/ leisure) without any negative feedback. You stayed in that room for more that 3-4 hours without any complaint. Sir, a hotel can redress or atleast try to redress any issue when it is brought out to light during a stay. Even then, our sincere apologies once again for the inconvenience caused to you! 

With high regards,

"FLEECERS & OPPORTUNSTS","2","2019-11","2019-11-20","As tour operators, we booked 03 rooms (06 Pax)for 3 nights( 06 & 07.Nov) (09 Nov) totaling 9 rooms.After 2 nights stay(06& 07 Nov), the guests checked out and left their luggage at Lindsay since we had booked for their stay on return from sunderbans which was on 09th Nov. Due to the cylone, the guests could not leave sunderbans on the 9th as scheduled as permission was not granted by the Govt for the ferry to ply. They had to stay back at Sunderbans and Thanks to Mr Vivek (+91-8334076522) who was our co-ordinator for sunderbans tour had taken care of our guests and accommodated them without even taking one extra penny and We do recognise his magnanimity  and help during this natural calamity. When we apprised Hotel Lindsay, the Manager  Mr Kanchan Mali (+91-9674165153) had bluntly told us that there cannot be a refund and if the guest don't turn up, the refund cannot be done. Airlines plying from Kolkata could not operate due to the cyclone and they have refunded the amount, BUT Hotel Lindsay, which is the heart of Kolkata refused...Lindsay has fleeced the guests in this regard and has resorted to an  unethical practice. We had even requested them to postpone the booking so that we could return the cost of the unoccupied rooms to the guests and utilise the booking/rooms at a convenient date when we have other guests travelling to kolkata. Even this,the manager Mr Kanchan Mali (+91-9674165153) refused to do and had the audacity to quote the hotel cancellation policy during natural calamity. SHAME, if this be the concept of Hospitality and the meaning of the word ""ATITHI DEVO BHAVA"". .I will be giving my feedback on all possible sites and shall apprise all guests to ""BEWARE"".

"Nice hotel in a good location.","4","2019-09","2019-11-08","The Linsday is a nice hotel in a busy and central area of Calcutta. The hotel has a pretty good wifi, fridge, good sized rooms (we had a Junior Suite approx. $100 a night Australian), a decent buffet breakfast and some friendly staff.
It is central to all you may want. It is surrounded by markets and outlet shops, there are numerous restaurants within walking distance and Eden Gardens, Victoria Memorial and central Calcutta are also walkable should you wish. There are two toasted sandwich shops on the corner of Lindsay Street, which I would recommend to take back to the hotel for lunch.
Just one word of warning. If your taxi is going to arrive in the evening, it is hard to drive to the hotel because of the crowds of shoppers and you may end up walking a little way.
Over all it was a good comfortable stay and our room looked out onto the markets below.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r725060769-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"386","313116046","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/a9/c5/8e/steve-p.jpg","386","682","1206","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdpaine","Steve P","B5798CFA168BD8BA36F99A9EDF5234F9",,"494999","Redcliffe, Australia","Redcliffe","sdpaine",,"Revenue Management","761938179","en","2020-07-28","Mihir Mohapatra","Dear Guest,

"Acceptable stay in crowded part of Kolkata. (3.5 stars?)","3","2019-10","2019-11-04","Comfortable stay in the busy New Market area.
The room was spacious with a good a/c, a working fridge,  and overlooked New Market.
Having stayed in this area in much cheaper backpacker style accommodation on multiple occasions, I can certainly say The Lindsay was a step up in quality and comfort. Whether it is worth the price is debatable(hence he 3 star rating compared to 4 star), but it was nice to have a clean spacious room with reliable hot water and buffet breakfast included.
I was checked in quickly when I arrived after midnight.
The buffet breakfast has a variety of options and while not being one of the best I have had in terms of quality it was more than acceptable. The staff in the dining room for the breakfast were excellent. Very attentive, polite and professional.
The room was clean and although the bathroom was a bit dated it was also clean and had all the toiletries provided.
New Market can be a noisy area (especially during festival times) but that is the case in the centre of all Indian cities. Being on the 8th floor helped a little with this.
The hotel has what looked like a well equipped gym, although I have never used a gym and did not do so here. I have never stayed anywhere in central Kolkata that does not have a slight smell of mustiness to it. The Lindsay was no exception to this. I do not believe it is the hotel itself, but the pipes and drains of this area.

The biggest plus of The Lindsay was the rooftop bar/restaurant. It is very modern, well maintained, has excellent staff and a varied selection of well prepared food. I wouldn't call it cheap but I certainly did NOT find it overpriced. It is a wonderful spot to sit in the evening. When there is a gentle breeze it is a pleasant retreat from the often stifling Kolkata atmosphere. It provides very good views across the city. Once again I can say the staff in the rooftop restaurant were very professional and the food was of good quality.
The door staff at hotel entrance were always very polite, and while the reception and room staff could maybe improve a touch on their professionalism, they were all friendly and polite.
I'm usually a backpacker when traveling in India so it was nice to have a proper hotel room for my first couple of nights on this trip.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r723930133-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"412","45631618","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/b8/48/82/shane-s.jpg","550","110","114","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaneS146","shane s","45D61FFF713433377463EDB04DCA9EE8",,"261599","Port Pirie, Australia","Port Pirie","ShaneS146",,"General Manager","784448109","en","2021-03-12","Ranjan Prasad","Dear Guest,

"Good stay in a crowded place","3","2019-09","2019-10-24","We were two families went to Kolkata for shopping and planned to stay near New Market and selected this hotel just behind the market and very near. But, entrance was so crowded that its difficult to park the car and take off. Customer service at front desk was average, not good and not bad. They served complimentary breakfast and enough for us to start the day. Price was comparatively high and that's why we shifted to another hotel nearby. This is almost a old hotel but they tried to maintain the rooms. Free WiFi and toiletries. Bed was comfortable and hot running water is also available. Surrounded by many Bengali restaurants.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r721086111-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"450","25946638","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8b/ea/0e/shafqatrabbi.jpg","329","58","262","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shafqatrabbi","shafqatrabbi","D9EFFEB82F1D5F9BA41E3C60DB8490D2",,"293936","Dhaka City, Bangladesh","Dhaka City","shafqatrabbi",,"Revenue Management","761943808","en","2020-07-28","Mihir Mohapatra","Dear Guest,

"Average hotel in a prime location","3","2019-09","2019-09-11","Primarily located at Kolkata's shopping hub, Lindsay must have seen its better days. Booked three executive rooms. All the room were not same upon checkin. The room I stayed had almost no view, though other two rooms were just okay!! Probably depends upon luck which room/view one shall get. Furniture's are outdated and few touch ups are in dying need. Only thing I liked about the washroom was its overhead fan!! Breakfast was good but not something extraordinary, that you can write about. Guy's sitting at the front desk has to handle guests with patience, could have been more polite. We noticed one of the front desk officer was literally shouting at a guest. Being said so in Kolkata if someone is in a food/shopping trip there's not much of option. Lindsay is one of the few, which fall into that category!!

"Great location, nice clean hotel","4","2019-04","2019-04-19","The best part is off course the location. Located just next to the New Market. So, if you are travelling for shopping, this one is certainly a great option. Keep in mind it's a very busy & crowded place with lots of option of street food.

We stayed in the Executive room which was spacious with clean bathroom. The Deluxe room is a bit small in size but enough for 02 adults. They provide bottled water, complimentary in room tea-coffee & standard bathroom amenities which was good. 

The hotel has a restaurant at the rooftop & another on the first floor where complimentary buffet breakfast is served. I must say there was enough variety & the food was tasty. Pls. check out the photos.

The metro is rail station is about a Kilometer away. Taxis are available throughout day & night.

"Pathetic stay","1","2019-01","2019-01-02","Hi 

I am staying in your hotel in room number 502 and on very first day I asked for a room change which is not happened till 2 Jan though I came at front desk two time and room move was refused to me by saying hotel is full though when I checked with house keeping he mentioned room are available.

Also on 2nd evening when I came back at 20:00 I asked for room change and a lady at front desk told me that she is sending me key which still not came.

And when I have a guest in room then at 2300 I am getting a call that I have to come down to pay for extra bed though I was repeadly telling him send me bed and will settle in morning.

And then I was again  ringed and he made me talk to you.but I am happy atleast you releasized that at 2300 guest should not get disturbed.

Please train your team mate as they are not their to help the guest they are following what is not ethical in hotel industry .as guard at floor is more attentive then them as he is veryhelping in nature and atleast acknowledge the presence of guest by wishing them.

But even after many followup my  room not moved .

Please share this with your team mate and tell them to follow log book which is bible of front office","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1438191-r643101215-Indismart_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452389795","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Damanjitmatharu","Damanjit","8C404323139EEEDA48DDAAC75F485924",,,,,"Damanjitmatharu",,"Front Office Manager","656206855","en","2019-03-03","HOTELINDISMART","Dear Guest,

We are extremely apologetic for the unpleasant experience what you had in our property. Please, be assured that we have taken your feedback very seriously and we have already shared all the points that you mentioned with the concerned departments but when we wanted to probe further, unfortunately, we did not find any booking made recently with the name of Mr. Hemjit (as you mentioned your name here) through any channel or direct means and we are completely unsure about your check in and check-out dates either. We would be immensely grateful to you if can kindly, share your contact number and the booking details with the Front Office Manager at frontofficemanager@indismart.in  for better understanding of the issues. Sir, we have been continuously training our staff to improve the service level and we ensure that we do not wish to repeat mistakes made in the past and trust us, we never endorse a culture of a 'Tips Friendly Hotel'. We wish to thank you for bringing out these service lapses into our notice. 
Again, my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused to you and we firmly believe that you would give us another chance to serve you soon at Indismart Hotel!

"Stay away from the garbage bin called Indismart Hotel","1","2018-03","2018-03-29","Staying for one night in IndiSmart Hotel, Kolkata easily ranks as one of the worst hotel experiences for me. The hygiene standards are appalling – my room (#409) was infested with bed bugs and mosquitoes. The linen was stained and soiled – everything from towels, napkins to bedcovers (see pics). 

The staff is atrocious – they demand to know why you need fresh linen. There was no hot water in the shower; but the housekeeping staffer shamelessly tells me that the cold water is actually quite warm; perhaps the poor bloke suffers from a skin disease.

Finally, when they say that their restaurant serves breakfast at 7 am, it actually means 7:45 am, because the staff loiters around aimlessly not knowing what to do.

"My last stay with IndiSmart","3","2018-02","2018-02-19","This is not my first time and infact 4th time revisit to this property.But I am utter dissapointed this time. I shall list all the items of dissapointment below and leave the decision to the readers.
1. Upon arrival I went to their inhouse cafe for a cup of coffee and requested FO to send my trolley either to my room or to the cafe. When done, I found my trolley sitting as it is. I carried it up, seeing which no one from FO offered any help to call a Bell Boy.
2. The room had dampended wall and I booked one of the best rooms @Premium/Premier room with BF
3. Bed base upholstry were torn at places
4. The luggage rack's sunmica were broken and coming off
5. Bathroom dustbin was old, rusty and broken. The lid was wobbling
6.Bath area door handle came of as I touched it and the screw fell off
7. I checked it on 17th around 930 am and called in FO for wifi access, I was promised a callback from IT which never happened until 18th morning where I called up IT directly

Now,

On 17th morning around 1030 I raised concern on their facebook page from point 2 to 6 but no one got back to me. One 18th afternoon I had to speak to FO in person and thats when they offered me to change my room (upgrade was not possible as I was already in their one of the best rooms) I refused the change cause shifting all stuffs from one room to their other is a headache.
Btw, the bathroom dustbin still remains the same, and I am sure that could have been changed or replaced but no one bothered.

ps: maintenance person came and fixed the door handle

ps: HK opens your room and does the cleaning even if you do not tag your door as make my room.

ps. HK broke the towel hanger in the bathroom

In short the journey I started in 2016, stops with thia trip now. I shall never return to IndiSmart again.

Good thing was that BF spread was good and had multiple options.

Bad things, late back attitude of service personnels. On 18th morning , no one even came forward to serve a glass of water to me on BF.
FO is the most lousy dept in the hotels, few chitchatter are hired who is more concerned with chit chat than customer service.

My check out was on 19th Feb, but I got a call from FO on 18th asking when shall I check out as it is already 12pm. This proofs lack of internal communication and no ground work done before contacting a customer.
I requested for a late check out which was already approved but effective 10am on 19th multiple people from FO started calling me to check when I am checking out and who approved late check out and staying beyond 12pm might call for half day rent.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1438191-r561621557-Indismart_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1553","149651529","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/eb/80/49/rounak-g.jpg","1616","25","93","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rounakg1985","Rounak Ghosh","7FF7406228CD1B3FC411326B3361F54C",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","rounakg1985",,"General Manager","568087939","en","2018-03-22","HOTELINDISMART","Dear Sir, we have taken your suggestions and observations very seriously.

"Sameeksha By Sachin - Location Is The Biggest Advantage For Business Travelers","3","2018-02","2018-02-17","I stayed at IndiSmart Hotel Kolkata during my official trip for 2 nights, I checked in on 2nd Feb 18 and checked out on 4th Feb 18. I stayed at 6th Floor. Rooms are not very spacious though neat and clean but space was sufficient for one guest. Bathroom is also very congested. View from Hotel Room was OK, one can not expect great view as office buildings are around and can be seen from the hotel. There is no swimming pool in the hotel. Room Service and restaurant services both were just average.They were taking time to serve at the room though the staff was courteous. Breakfast menu and dinner menu was limited and average in taste. Good part was that they provided me packed breakfast on my request. Housekeeping was just OK. WiFi facility was available and working properly. The biggest advantage of the hotel is the proximity with offices, malls, cinema and outside restaurants.

Overall I would say that this hotel is average hotel, OK for business travelers and that too for short stay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1438191-r561163288-Indismart_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"719","195446348","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/a6/46/4c/sameekshaksachin.jpg","719","112","405","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SameekshakSACHIN","SameekshakSACHIN","DA65B80023747F214A8F9515D79B88BA",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","SameekshakSACHIN",,"General Manager","568088514","en","2018-03-22","HOTELINDISMART","Dear Guest,

"Nice Budget Hotel w","3","2017-07","2017-07-03","Location:

Hotel is ideally located at the heart of Salt lake city surrounded with big MNC's / corporates and government offices.

Ambience:

Hotel has a nice / decent ambience. The rooms are spacious, clean and nicely decorated. The furniture / towels are clean and tidy. Washroom is well maintained and quite tidy. Room has 32"" LCD, fridge, AC and table / sofa.

Service:

Room service is slow. Food quantity served is quite less compared to the price one pays. Hence I would not recommend you to opt for their room service, rather go out you will find many good  and better options for eating.

Buffet Breakfast:

Buffet breakfast is just fine, its not very lavish but good enough to kick start your day. Though the place where the buffet is offered is not too big so at times you may struggle to find seating space. The offer from Paranthas to South Indian stuff like Idlis / Dosa. Omelette is available on request. As far as non-veg item is concerned they will only have single dish to chose from. Few bakery items like muffins, cakes would be available along with fresh fruits (2-3 varieties). For omelette you may have to wait for 20-30 mins hence it is recommended to order the moment you enter the restaurant for breakfast.

Staff:

Staff is warm and friendly. Check-in process was quick and efficient.

Negative:

Speed of wi-fi is not upto the mark. Hence at times you struggle to work. Room service / quality / quantity of food is not upto the mark. The have a small gym but I hardly found it operating.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1438191-r498127132-Indismart_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"2560","70936504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/3a/67/b8/deepaksaxena88.jpg","1920","1056","670","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deepaksaxena88","deepaksaxena88","65ECF6D956787B9E620E2AFA4CE82535",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","deepaksaxena88",,"General Manager","503175870","en","2017-07-18","HOTELINDISMART","Greetings from Indismart Hotel Kolkata!!

But as soon as I checked into to the room everything looked perfect but only for 05 minutes as I was trying to open the curtains the whole window area was filled with filth and then as I entered the Bathroom, the bath tub was broken and very badly maintained [check pics].As I spoke with a staff he told me that the Hotel is undergoing Renovation and the rooms on the floors which were not renovated were being sold at cheaper prices.

The Room was big and good but the flooring started showing cracks and dust accumulated in the cracks and I just stayed in this room for a day and I asked them to shift me to a different room as for using the shower you have to get into the Bath tub and as I stood on the Tub it started cracking so taking a shower became Impossible.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1438191-r489248922-Indismart_Hotel-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1757","390459176","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/45/ef/28/epicureantales.jpg","1757","59395","14691","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiovalentino","Georgio Valentino Rayala","CCA8F7076B3B2534FA6F80B13A448CEE",,"297586","Hyderabad, India","Hyderabad","georgiovalentino",,"General Manager","510389153","en","2017-08-08","HOTELINDISMART","Dear Guest,

We found a ride with a local and when we arrived at the hotel little concern was exhibited by staff.  Our room was okay, but overall the place was quite dreary.

"If your existing rooms are badly maintained, renovated rooms would degenerate fast too !","3","2015-03","2015-03-13","Pros: 1. The hotel is close to the airport, <3 km. 2. Its on the main road. 3. It has a bar & restaurant which operates till 11:30 Night. 4. Early morning flt - you can grab a sandwich, cookies, tea/coffie at reception from 04:30hrs. 
Cons: 1. existing rooms obviously have not been well maintained. Upper floor rooms have been renovated but if the standard of O&M remains the same as it is today then even the renovated rooms will meet the same fate as the old ones - bad. I was first given a room which had the AC power pin with bare studs pins ready to kill an unaware customer; the water plumbing in toilet was choked which resulted in low pressure.
2. Vis -a-vis rooms size, decore and facilities its slightly high priced. 
3. Its under renovation.

To the credit of the management they did change my room from the second floor to the 4th floor to a better room - after 1.5 hrs.

"Clueless, completely out of depth, highway robbery","1","2014-11","2014-11-16","I had a flight into Kolkata past 11 p.m. and had to catch a train from Howrah very early the next morning. So it made sense to check into what I hoped was a function B&B kind of hotel either very to the airport or the station.  That's how I discovered O2 on the website.  

Knowing I'd be very tired on arrival, I arranged for an airport pick up.  This is where the horror story begins.  On finding no one waiting at the exit, I called the handset of the driver who was supposed to pick me up - no response. I tried a couple of times again before he picked up and denied that he was on duty to pick me up. I then called hotel switchboard. It took them a couple of  minutes to figure out that I actually had a reservation.  

As is customary, the mobile signal in India kept dropping frequently.  I was constantly transferred between O2 Oxygen hotel and O2 VIP hotel (I found out later they were adjacent) before someone finally admitted that a mistake had been made and a driver will pick me up shortly.   Lo and behold ! The same driver who denied my pick up came to finally get me after an incredible 40 mins PAST my exit from the airport.  

For this ROYAL service, the hotel charged me INR 350 and refused to refund it !!!!

On the way to the hotel, I was informed by the driver (incidentally a rickety old smashed up vehicle in which the AC barely worked !!!!) that both hotels had just one car between them and that such experiences are fairly common and delays are always expected. 

I asked if the hotel bar/dining room might be open since I was hungry.  He said doubtful at the O2 Oxygen hotel, maybe at the O2 VIP.  The one at O2 Oxygen closes at midnight and thanks to the delays, I obviously missed it. 

The check in staff was profusely apologetic. However, would not entertain thoughts of any refund nor would volunteer to have food arranged from adjacent O2 VIP hotel if that hotel's dining was still open.

The sight of the room was astounding .... a visibly very old long handle broom and a smelly piece of rag was parked right next to the entrance door of the room.  The Wi-Fi internet did not work, the sofa gave me shudders..there were black stain marks from spilt water or whatever all over it.  The bathroom smelt overpoweringly of phenyl, hair was all over the floor.  

When the AC started, it roared.  The plastic casing of the AC was glued onto the frame via tapes.  Pillows were as thin as towels and the bedsheet looked as if someone slept in it before I moved in. 

Thank God my misery was over in 5 hours.  These bums charged me INR 4,100 (US$70approx.) for these marvelous courtesies. 

Never ever again.  

Anywhere else in the world, you can happily sue these guys and make a fortune.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r240138856-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"205","19820661","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/75/avatar057.jpg","205","6","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PK33333","Priyaranjan K","7C6EDC29B92BD4ECF35CEE75FE4F3898",,"294262","Singapore","Singapore","PK33333",,,,,,,,"VIP Road Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700052 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700052","West Bengal","VIP Road","Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali","1156256","22.632792","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.43444","Hotel O2 Oxygen","218","3.3","18","22","79","69","30","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d1156256-Reviews-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://loharukahotels.com"

"Average Hotel with central location","3","2019-03","2019-03-15","I stayed in this hotel recently for six days.
The hotel is situated centrally just opposite of New Market.
If you are going to Kolkata for shopping,I think this is a good place to stay.All shops are nearby.
But don’t stay here if you are going for holidays.Rooms are not as good compared to the price.
Some front desk staff are good.Specially the the gate people and room cleaners are very good.
Breakfast and food is awesome.Be careful you may have diarrhoea.
My advice ,stay in some other good hotels for holidays and stay here for 1–2 days only if you are going for shopping .","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r658603240-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452386713","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","1200","8","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awahed19","awahed19","060AA2A5BDA658F5F5DE9100AA132AD6",,,,,"awahed19",,"Revenue Management","761939050","en","2020-07-28","Mihir Mohapatra","Dear Guest,

"Average Hotel with a Great Location","3","2018-10","2019-01-15","I have stayed in this Hotel during the Biggest Festival in Kolkata @ Durga Puja. I have booked this hotel from one of the online website. I have even gone through feedback online before booking it. Once i reached the Airport i took an Uber to the Hotel. I would have given up driving , but the Uber Driver Mr. Prashant had great patience to drive us through the narrow lanes of New Market which is totally filled by Pedestrian. It was chock a Block. I really thanked this guy for taking so much pain to drop us at the door of the hotel. Its in a small lane bang opp to New Market. Location Good everything nearby. Taxi to Metro and in the midst of shopping place. 
Very Small reception, Staff was courteous. Based on my booking they allotted me a room. After seeing the room i was shocked, the room was so small that 2 people cannot move at the same time. There was almost no space after the bed to move . So when i complained then i was given an option of upgrading it to a better spacious room with a price. I agreed as i didnt had any choice rather than to pay extra. 
I would really appreciate the bell  boy staff ( forgot his name) he recommended a room newly renovated for me to the Front Office staff. The room was better. 
Breakfast was good with good choice
Room Service and Housekeeping Staff is good. 

Need to improve the room size and also the looks of the older rooms.

The buffet breakfast had a variety of different items and was delicious. The building has quite a vintage look. The rooftop restaurant is quite famous in the area and has a great ambience.

Our stay was very comfortable, and the room was neat and tidy, with all the usual amenities.  The location was great - directly opposite Hogg Market, and close to all the tourist areas we wanted to see.  It's a pretty busy street due to Hogg Market, so be quick when you get out of the car!  There are plenty of staff to help with bags and to greet you on arrival, and check in was efficient.  There was a large restaurant with a good selection of breakfast options, and the service was good.

"Great location and experience in Kolkata","4","2018-03","2018-03-12","We stayed at the Lindsay for 5 nights while attending a friend's wedding in Kolkata. I think the best thing about the hotel is the location, as it made for easy sightseeing in the city centre and was also easy to get back as we could simply catch a cab and ask for New Market. 

We found the staff to be very polite and friendly, and the room to be perfectly clean. The room was cleaned everyday and we were given 4 fresh water bottles each day which we could keep icy cold in the fridge in the room. 

The breakfast is mainly Indian food, as the guests themselves are mainly Indian! Although for foreign travellers there is also standard cereals toast and eggs available. 

Overall we found no fault with the Lindsay and would happily stay here again. We stayed on the 8th floor and found it nice and quiet.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r565985166-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"50","258532849","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/68/e5/f1/wonderlustmaeve4life.jpg","50","3","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850meadhbhn","Meadhbh","56DE4EFCAF45DFF57B3C51BD4130D700",,,,,"850meadhbhn",,"Manager","566773178","en","2018-03-15","Thelindsaykolkata","Dear Guest,

"Good location but average service","3","2014-05","2014-05-07","I booked this hotel for a single night stop-over in Kolkatta for a client meeting. It is very conveniently located near the airport. I was not however, thrilled by the service. It was not bad, but nothing extraordinary. The room was spacy and relatively clean. One of the issues was my room key was not working, and they could not fix it. So, to enter my room I had to wait for the person with the Master key to come in and open it. This could have been very annoying if I had stayed longer. The most absurd thing was their hotel policy. I went with my colleague to the upper floor restaurant, but was told we need to go to the ground floor as the upper floor restaurant was-""Only for families"". To put things in perspective, this was the middle of a saturday afternoon and we were preparing for a business meeting, so we found the attitude baffling. The ground floor restaurant had a better ambience than the upper floor. For the price, the hotel gave decent service, but is strictly average. Oh, and the hot water was not working in the bathroom.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r204471575-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","13","15","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikrantY","Vikrant Y","3AB7ABF7E4BDA97DD88AA26326266C77",,"1532344","Navi Mumbai, India","Navi Mumbai","VikrantY",,,,,,,,"VIP Road Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700052 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700052","West Bengal","VIP Road","Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali","1156256","22.632792","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.43444","Hotel O2 Oxygen","218","3.3","18","22","79","69","30","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d1156256-Reviews-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://loharukahotels.com"

"bed and room floor very clean, but rest of room?","3","2014-03","2014-03-17","This applies to the O2 Vip, other rooms may be different.

Bed, towels, floor are absolutely clean. THat is very important to me.
Distance/time from airport is excellent (10 mins).

In my room, you wouldn't want to touch the inroom menu. The walls have been painted 10 (?) years ago. I made sure not to touch them but have a cushion behind me when I leaned against the wall, sitting on the bed. Do I want to put my fresh clothes for tomorrow onto the easy chair? I am not sure. Door, table, night table, cupboard,   hm...? I don't need 4 star hotels, but this was the most worn down of the budget hotels I visited in India
Except for the menu, all this is not really dirty (well, the walls are not clean or freshly remade), but very worn out.
Just like a run down version of a ginger.

In addition to typical road noice which I found acceptable in a room to the side of the hotel, there is a mosque very nearby calling out several times a day and at 5 am on the Monday I stayed here.

I think it is perfectly ok for night in, morning out, espeially due to its perfect distance to airport. Unfortunately, I arrived at 2pm  and felt this is not a good place for me to stay half a day waiting for my business partner.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r197700688-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KlausGB","Gaby P","070086CF0F4896195F03EB90D98F7AC2",,"187337","Frankfurt, Germany","Frankfurt","KlausGB",,,,,,,,"VIP Road Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700052 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700052","West Bengal","VIP Road","Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali","1156256","22.632792","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.43444","Hotel O2 Oxygen","218","3.3","18","22","79","69","30","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d1156256-Reviews-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://loharukahotels.com"

"A good option near Kolkata's airport","3","2014-02","2014-02-11","We booked at o2 hotel after scouring TripAdvisor reviews and determining that the hotel was the best mediocre option out of all the mediocre options.  It turned out to be a pretty good stay, and we would certainly stay there again if in the same position with flights.  Arriving a midnight and departing at 10:30AM, the hotel gave us a great rest, two complimentary water bottles (much appreciated), and a very delicious mainly South-Indian style breakfast (much, much appreciated). 

The cost is steep (though you're of course paying for convenience and location), and, at 350Rs, the hotel's airport pick-up service is quite a bit more expensive than the pre-paid taxi service (for 110Rs).  The whole place feels a bit musty and cigarettey, but on the whole, this is totally manageable, and we are very glad we stayed and very thankful to the staff who stayed up to greet us.

The biggest advantage is that plenty of taxis are available right in front of the hotel, even at odd hours such as 3 am.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r187230888-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"50","129376930","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/b6/22/a2/sayan1013.jpg","50","11","34","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sayan1013","Sayan S","F8B12E9F5F40D97ACE55525092530CDF",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","sayan1013",,,,,,,,"VIP Road Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700052 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700052","West Bengal","VIP Road","Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali","1156256","22.632792","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.43444","Hotel O2 Oxygen","218","3.3","18","22","79","69","30","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d1156256-Reviews-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://loharukahotels.com"
"Simply Superb","5","2018-03","2018-03-03","After searching 5 hotels at midnight in the new market area of Kolkata this is the best hotel considering the location and money. Every staff was wonderful from reception to bell boy to restaurant staffs to security guard. Breakfast was also pretty good which includes 4 types of juices. Room ambience was very nice. There's a fan in the toilet for summer times which is the first I've ever seen. My 3 year old kid enjoyed a lot cause room was specious (executive room). Rooftop restaurant was also good. Very good views. I could've given 4 star but comparing 5 hotels near new market this hotel is worth 5 star.

"Some good. Some can be improved. ","4","2018-02","2018-02-23","Stayed there for 4 nights in Feb 2018.

Pros-
1. Outstanding, brilliant location. 
2. Very good complementary breakfast. 
3. Room is good with comfy bed. You have both AC and fan, basic complementary toiletries, clean floors, clean towels. 
4. Availability of hot water all the time. 

Cons- 
1. Extremely poor wifi. I had this feedback before booking and it came True. 
2. Except few (for example, Mr. Saikot, very well mannered) most of the staffs were not courteous. You will have a feeling that, by having a room there, they are actually doing a favor to you. Talking always in a 007 tone with no smile. 
3. Very light color/brown 2 layer curtains which easily allows the daylight to get in and eventually hampers sleeping. 

I still recommend this hotel for any visitor to stay as the cons I mentioned can be improved. I am also looking forward to stay again in this hotel in my next visits.

"Nice Hotel at he Best Location","4","2018-01","2018-02-05","The location is very good, just on the iconic New Market. Park street where some of the city's best bars and restaurants are located is just 5 minutes walk. Clean property, reasonable service. The noise level at the room s pretty high though. The breakfast is good if you like Indian food; otherwise the choices are limited. Cost wise it might appear little price but if the savings on taxi fare is considered it is reasonable. Overall it's a good place to stay for couple of days, particularly if you are in Kolkata for shopping and the street food.
The roof top bar is also good; though we ordered for something and got another dish.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r558587819-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"3000","568247161","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/de/c3/79/kakoli-c.jpg","3000","23","119","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kak0lic","Kakoli C","0D773B272215F1E0C770876238941346",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","kak0lic",,"Manager","560353336","en","2018-02-13","Thelindsaykolkata","Dear Guest,

"Deeply Disappointed","2","2018-01","2018-01-28","We stayed 2 nights. When we checked in, the guy said it was a 'deluxe room', but we were greeted by flecked walls on the 5th floor. On the second day, I asked the manager about the wifi service. But it was simply ignored. The worst was when we returned, there was no water in the room. When asked, one guy came with uncapped water bottles, and when I reminded him that we had not been given the complementary water bottles, he had to run to fetch them. If we had stayed in one of the cavernous lodges in Sudder Street, then these would not have been a concern. But The Lindsay presents itself as a star hotel, and yet it gives nothing to its customers.

There were homeless people always sleeping outside the hotel and piles of trash/dirt right outside the door. I would expect them to keep their surrounding space clean, at least by the door. The hallways were dusty from not vacuuming and we develeoped severe dust allergies while in Kolkata so this did not help. Overall, the hotel provided all the necessary accommodations (nice rooms, restroom, daily cleaning, etc).

"Better than many hotels in Kolkata","4","2017-12","2018-01-01","I stayed with my family in the hotel for 8 nights. We booked two rooms. First seven nights we got our expected rooms in the higher floor - bright, full of day lights. However, we didn't get the similar room when we came back from a two day trip. The rooms were already paid but the relevant staffs didn't book our rooms properly. I felt they were unprofessional. Most of the staffs including the desk staffs were really good, especially Mr. Deepak. They were attentive to our issues and took quick steps. I felt that the hotel need to improve in the quality assurance and top level monitoring. I have found dust and dirt in the rooms even after regular cleaning. When I took it to their notification they immediately cleaned it. They have system but not well monitored.  The cleaning staffs need to learn the value of cleanliness. The rooms have good toilet amenities, fresh towels every day, flow of hot and cold water, enough drinking water. Security is also good. Breakfast is good but become monotonous after couple of days as the items are almost same every day. They need to offer live egg corner and few more items alternative days to bring diversity. The rooms in the higher floor are better in terms of fresh air and natural lights. I liked the room 601. It has big window and good view of Hogg Market and beyond. They have good wifi connection and each room gets three device connection. The hotel management can think to put a travel desk which would be really helpful for the guests.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r550764709-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"574","296168145","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/a7/2a/d1/shashankasaadi.jpg","574","64","168","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShashankaSaadi","ShashankaSaadi","D1DC134F5A28D1109ACAE54ECF4F1D78",,"293936","Dhaka City, Bangladesh","Dhaka City","ShashankaSaadi",,"Manager","551706978","en","2018-01-05","Thelindsaykolkata","Dear Guest,

"Great hotel right in the centre of the action!","4","2017-11","2017-12-21","Stayed at The Lindsay twice this trip and was impressed by this mid-range hotel.  Bed linen was new and clean.  I always travel with a sleeping bag liner in India and there was no need to use it at this hotel.  The mattresses were comfortable.  If you haven't stayed in Kolkata before, it's a busy, noisy city and very hard to get away from the constant noise, so don't expect peace and quiet anywhere except for a few hours between 11pm and 4am.
On my second visit there was a housekeeping issue in the bathroom and it was remedied immediately.  I did request that the shower drain be cleared (snaked), but pretty sure that did not happen.  Find this is a common problem in India.
Both reception staff and front door staff were extremely helpful in printing something for me, accommodating a room request, storing bags, dealing with cabs and beggars.
Breakfast is included and the buffet is quite extensive including both Indian and western flavours.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r548432286-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1729","61482791","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/aa/27/27/simplysusan62.jpg","2594","63","142","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SadhanaCanada","SadhanaCanada","543289C5F285B9E0F96123B306F22A50",,"182206","Gibsons, Canada","Gibsons","SadhanaCanada",,"Manager","551707322","en","2018-01-05","Thelindsaykolkata","Dear Guest,

Greetings from the Lindsay Kolkata!!!

It was a pleasure having you staying with us. We had gone through your review and found it was incorrect. You had booked for single occupancy room through expedia.com id no – 946916377 for four nights and paid accordingly. When you arrived in the hotel you were accompanied by three additional person. As per the hotel norms we have charged a very nominal amount for additional three person who are not booked through expedia.com. Let us know which hotel in the world would allow a booking on single occupancy for a room and allow additional three person to stay free. Hence there would be no refund as we have not charged anything extra and you paid exactly for three additional person. You have the right to post review but kindly ensure it is logical and correct. 
We at the Lindsay always strive to give value for money. Nevertheless we look forward for your next visit at our hotel.

"Great staff","3","2017-09","2017-09-20","The best part of this hotel was the staff, who were extremely helpful and courteous. The location is a bit of a mixed bag though. First off, it's located right in the center of the city, making it easy to go anywhere. On the opposite side is the fact that it's right in the middle of New Market area, which means it's heavily crowded at all times of day and cars can't stop for long here.

Other than that, we didn't like the room we got. It was located right at the end of the floor, had a worn down look, the shower head was not properly fitted, and it was very small. Plus, there was no proper window in the room. For the price we paid, I was expecting much better.

For the room, I'd rate this 1 or 2 stars. But the staff's behavior adds one more star.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r526025583-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"460","573009281","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/27/6d/81/bdgamer.jpg","460","38","275","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdgamer","Rajiv","72A20B8E8F055DCFAF3DF0C740D87F5F",,"154943","Vancouver, Canada","Vancouver","bdgamer",,"Manager","530675815","en","2017-10-06","Thelindsaykolkata","Dear Guest,

"Close.... but no Cigar","3","2017-07","2017-07-27","‘The Lindsay’ hotel located in Lindsay Street, directly opposite the SS Hogg Market is pitching itself at the higher end of the market.
The Indians do a spectacularly good job of creating ‘high end’ luxury hotels, ‘The Lindsay’ is not in that league, it seems to hover somewhere around upper ‘mid range’. 

Check in is an efficient but lengthy process.
Downstairs dinning room is well run.
My room was just okay but looking tired and had previously been occupied by smokers (I found this a problem). The staff did his best to clear the smell without success. It is NOT a fault of the hotels staff. It IS a problem with hotel policy.

A/C – WiFi – TV – Fridge all work well.
The building is safe and secure.
Elevators x2 reach all floors.
The rooftop restaurant looks good.

A bit of a ‘make over’ and a ‘no smoking’ policy would make this hotel a viable alternative, currently, there is better value to be had in the neighbourhood. 

My experience at ‘The Lindsay’ is that of one person on one night – please check other guests reviews.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r506321080-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"769","265804465","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/d7/da/b1/barry-s.jpg","769","12","32","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V611HQbarrys","Barry Mc","82265F9D48225220F55E9A1B931A1EB2",,"255100","Melbourne, Australia","Melbourne","V611HQbarrys",,"Guest Relations Manager","506691097","en","2017-07-29","Thelindsaykolkata","Dear Guest,

Staff behavior was good. Room service could be a bit better. Front desk staffs needs to be more polite. Porters/guards are super helpful.

Enjoyed the stay & would love to go back.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r503481239-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"3002","107175465","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/63/5e/29/shahjad-j.jpg","2628","29","68","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shahjadj","Shahjad J","E868E7ED3A47CFB20EB84C272B93C83E",,,,,"shahjadj",,"Guest Relations Manager","504346464","en","2017-07-21","Thelindsaykolkata","Dear Mr.Shahjad,

"Short stay for shopping","3","2017-03","2017-04-02","For someone who loves victorian architecture and heritage Kolkata is the place to be. 3 things I love about Kolkata is the architecture, street food and shop till you drop! The Lindsay is nestled in the chaotic yet vibrant New Market area. For people who love to shop and enjoy the amazing street food The Lindsay is a great place to anchor. Once you step out of the Hotel, you have the New Market and underground Simpark A/C market right opposite to the hotel and turn left to walk towards the Muslim street if u fancy halal food and Panjabi ladies wear at bargain prices. walk further down the lane you'll reach the main road and on your right will be the Grand Oberoi Hotel and small renovated boutique hotels like The Corner Courtyard where you can enjoy some quite leisure time. 

The room we stayed in was quite spacious for an extra bed to be fitted since we were 3. The Hotel offers a free breakfast with the rooms. The breakfast layout is small yet modest and offers both veg and non-veg and has a touch of english breakfast too. There is round the clock room service, although the daily ""Make my room"" service needs improvement. We left the hotel right after breakfast and asked them to clean our room, but everyday when we came back we had to call housekeeping for toiletries and toilet paper that was finished and not replenished during the cleaning service. Another problem we faced was the hotel only provides 1 key card for the room. We were three people and all going in different directions, so we had to leave the key card at the reception in case any of us came back before the others and needed access to the room. 

Having said all that, the biggest plus point is that the hotel lobby is a safe place to leave your shopping or schedule deliveries to. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The hotel also offers spa services in-rooms and on the 9th floor. however there is only 1 male masseuse for all guests and it opens from 6:30am till 8:30pm. Overall it was a comfortable and satisfying stay at The Lindsay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d658868-r472254898-The_Lindsay-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452392461","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg","1200","0","19","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nabeelar","Nabeela R","3E2D19A45A33F94CF7430D187D466B85",,,,,"nabeelar",,"Guest Relations Manager","473514490","en","2017-04-07","Thelindsaykolkata","Dear Guest,

Room tariff is too high equivalent to some 4 star property but there is nothing like 4 star in this hotel. They should charge half of what they are charging currently for the services they providing.

"Total Rip Off ( O2 VIP)","2","2013-07","2013-08-06","This is my second review on this property. In my previous visit I had stayed in their old building and it was OK. Since I was not really satisfied, this time around I made the reservation in the new property which was supposed to be ""better"". But it turned out to be a mistake.The prices for all rooms have gone up by more than Rs.500 for nothing. The rooms are smaller than the old building. The pics posted on their site are tricked(refer my pic).Moreover, my room was stinking when i walked in and the sheets were damp too. After i complained the receptionist, a room boy was sent with a freshener and that's how they took care of the smell. The bathroom was stinking too and I had to keep the exhaust on the whole time. Noone would expect these things when you pay Rs.4200 for room. For this kind of price you deserve a lot more. They should visit the Ginger Hotels in a small city like Agartala where you get one of the cleanest & spacious rooms for Rs.1500( it was a special offer price when I visited). Even in a tourist place like Goa, I had a fantastic room at the Park for almost similar price ( Rs.4600 in 2012). The only saving grace was the food which was good.

If someone has to money to waste, please stay at Hotel O2 VIP, Kolkata, instead of just dropping your money purse into Hoogly river.

First of all, what pics you see in travel portals are common for both O2 Oxygen and O2 VIP. Literally these two are next door to each other and belong to the same management. O2 VIP is the new buliding, you may choose O2 VIP. If you look at travel portals, you may find the pics are all same for both the hotels. Don't get misguided with that. O2 Oxygen is old building and renovation is in progress. Straight forward, Hotel Management is cheating travellers by showing same pics for both the properties.

The breakfast is delicious with Indian menu (2) The staff at the hotel are well-mannered and helpful and I may add a special mention of Bubai Biswas at the front desk (3) The hotel is moderately priced and is worth the money (4) The location of the hotel is such that the hotel has no say in controlling the surroundings and the surrounding is not pretty (5) The hotel management is trying its best to renovate and build some structures to have a better appearance for entrance and I see some construction at the front entrance to beautify the entrance by concreting the surface and making it look nice.(6)The food quality and quantity are good (7) The bedding and pillows need to improve in the cushioning quality and the windows need to be large (8) The room is spacious including the bath room (9) More control needs to be exercised on 'smoking' in restaurant and aisle.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r142833963-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"1200","452387929","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","1200","2","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/granddaughter9","granddaughter9","4E7D337F40C81ACE6C780CA75E3D1552",,,,,"granddaughter9",,,,,,,,"VIP Road Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700052 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700052","West Bengal","VIP Road","Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali","1156256","22.632792","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.43444","Hotel O2 Oxygen","218","3.3","18","22","79","69","30","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d1156256-Reviews-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://loharukahotels.com"

"Very Good for Transit","4","2012-09","2012-09-23","The problem travelling to Dhaka from Bangalore is that there are few choices. I have more often done the Delhi route - only because there are no convenient flights from Kolkata during the day (at least not on the airlines I use most). This time I had no choice but to stay overnight in Kolkata because of commitments at home and the need to be in Dhaka by 10am on the next day.
Found O2 on the net and the proximity to the airport was what caught the attention.
No regrets - Sambu picked us up from the airport and we were at the hotel in 10 minutes. There are two O2s - we stayed at the O2 VIP. Check in was easy and check out equally rapid.
The room is decent - looked a little dingy in the night conditions but comfortable all the same. Taking the stairs from and to the room can out you off - because the stairway does seem a little tight and dirty. 
They have a coffee shop (groundfloor), a restaurant (first floor) and a loud (on a Saturday night)disco in the basement. We had some Indian bread and chicken (kurchan) for dinner - really delicious.
If you are a light sleeper the occasional honk from the road may be disturbing but if the objective is to wake up early and get to the airport by 5am then it actually helps!
Bottom line - definitely recommended for transits.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r140999888-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"413","207003783","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/56/a0/87/bobyouruncle.jpg","413","170","349","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobYourUncle","BobYourUncle","B3FA4DB457341046CA0180EF9A7211E3",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","BobYourUncle",,,,,,,,"VIP Road Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700052 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700052","West Bengal","VIP Road","Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali","1156256","22.632792","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.43444","Hotel O2 Oxygen","218","3.3","18","22","79","69","30","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d1156256-Reviews-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://loharukahotels.com"
"Strictly average","3","2012-08","2012-08-25","This review is about the old O2 hotel, which is one building away from the new O2 hotel. I was attending a friend's wedding in Kolkata and the venue happened to be close to this hotel and the airport. Hence i was put up here. I stayed for just one night and in that sense it does the job. The food was not great and the service was not great in the restaurant. Me and my friend had to wait for almost 45 mins to get 2 starters inspite of being the only customers there!
The buffet breakfast on offer was ordinary. If you are looking for a place to just dump your luggage and go around, just to come back to sleep, then this hotel is a good bet. There is a big Haldiram's shop 5 minutes away from the hotel which can be checked out.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304558-d1156256-r138373282-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html",,"366","38133379","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/45/de/83/anupg10.jpg","550","72","124","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnupG10","Anup Guruvugari","E0C89FE00C12FAE894B63D621DA55D47",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","AnupG10",,,,,,,,"VIP Road Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700052 India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","India","700052","West Bengal","VIP Road","Ramkrishna Pally, Kaikhali","1156256","22.632792","Kolkata (Calcutta), Kolkata District, West Bengal","88.43444","Hotel O2 Oxygen","218","3.3","18","22","79","69","30","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d1156256-Reviews-Hotel_O2_Oxygen-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html","http://loharukahotels.com"
