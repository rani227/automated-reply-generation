Odd experience,3,2024-02,19-02-2024,"We had booked a family room showing 3 separate beds. The room we were given had a double bed, plus a sofa with bedding provided. Comfortable enough, but not what was advertised.
Check-in was a rigmarole. Receptionist took almost an hour to complete our registration, which involved the usual sign in, handing over of our foreign passport, but then he went away (with our passports, always a nerve-racking time)  and proceeded to laboriously photo copy the main page, then meticulously cut out the photos and paste into another book.  Of course he stopped for dinner during this exercise. Very odd.
The breakfast room (breakfast not included) was equally odd. A large room, it had two small tables and then chairs spread around each wall. When our group of three moved a chair to be together, an attendant came over and put it back against the wall. Very odd.
Location is excellent on V.N. Road close to Marine Drive.

Lack of communication,1,2020-09,19-09-2020,"It’s a fact that Covid-19 has hit hard on the Tourism and Hospitality sector 
globally and unfortunately it has stopped people - who like to explore the world – 
from travelling.
It’s also a fact that prior to Covid-19 hotels have been able to stay 
in business and survive due to travelers who were more than happy to pay them a 
visit enjoying the hospitality during their stay.
I am sure that after the pandemic situation this interaction of reciprocity will 
remain unchanged.
What is truly disappointing is that – during these hard times - you’re being 
ignored by the hotel when trying to cancel your booking after having 
reached out to the them by email for assistance during months without any 
response. These are difficult times for everybody so a little help and 
cooperation is appreciated.
Guess my expectations for basic Customer service and good manners from Chateau Windsor were overrated.
Given the fact that there have been recent reviews on them, I can only come to 
the conclusion that they are open for business and reluctant to respond to my email for whatever reason.
Nevertheless, hoping to visit India when it is safe to travel again.

【房间】我们订的双床，不过给了个三人间522，房间比较大，还有阳台，从阳台上可以看到海——也算海景房了呢[调皮]设施不算多么好，但是基本需求都能满足。晚上睡觉也没觉得吵。
【餐饮】酒店的早餐不是自助，自己打9，餐饮部会送来，一个蛋饼（素的给一小碗炒饭一样的东东，荤的加了午餐肉等在蛋里），两片吐司+黄油+果酱，一壶红茶+奶，一个香蕉或橘子。简单，但也吃得饱。
【服务】我们上午到的，前台也给我们腾出房间来了。要热水、要碗，也都很热情地送来。
这里每个楼下面都有一个“保安”，负责提东西、叫车之类，每次都主动打招呼。
老式电梯上下楼，都有人按电梯。
最后一天我们退了房，买了东西没地方整理行李，人家会开到一半，让我们进会议室整理箱子，也是很体贴。
【问题】卫生状况有点差强人意，用过的粥碗（基本舔干净了…）放在桌上，满满的蚂蚁！！！",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r747277796-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

The Shining Star ✨ of Hotel Parle Intl is  Duty Manager Mr Vijayan,4,2025-07,08-08-2025,"This was my 1st visit to the hotel but it did not felt like I m cuming to this hotel for the 1st time. Duty Manager Mr Vijayan was very courteous of all the people I met at the hotel. The way he welcomes u and helps u by going out of the way. He made my stay so wonderful that it felt like I m staying at my own home. I wud love to cum back to the hotel and recommend my family and friends to stay in hotel parle International. The most annoying thing about the hotel is wherever u go people are just behind u for the feedback. Housekeeping cums to your room in the evening disturbing u for the feedback. When u go the restaurant people over there disturb u they will not let u have your food also. I m annoyed with this behaviour of the people at the hotel.It seems they have been instructed by the management to take the feedback from the guest. As per my understanding the feedback is given at the time of check out before u leave but at this hotel feedback is taken right after u check in to ur room. Wifi connectivity is too poor at hotel. One thing I like to point out is when u call the room service no one is der to pickup the call and same thing is with the housekeeping, I think the calls are re-routed to the front desk and when u call for the water bottle it takes atleast half hour even after repeated calls because housekeeping is busy taking the feedbacks from the room. The first day I check in and  ask for the water bottle in the evening they give u free of cost in return for the good feedback whereas if u ask for the water bottle the 2nd day ther will charge u. Other people at the front desk are also helpful like Sachin, Ruchita and Rohit but out of all these people Duty Manager Mr Vijayan is the Shinning Star ✨ ⭐",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r1023257347-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452389359,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,1200,0,1,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherpa46794168825,Sherpa46794168825,9F5B00A6DCA257C164273F005110B666,,,,,Sherpa46794168825,,,,,,,,"B.N.

Parle Local,1,2024-11,03-12-2024,"First the postives  - adequately manned and cheerful security staff, spacious parking lot, alert check out staff, sturdy and comfortable beds,  and a great housekeeping staffer called Shyam Singhji who was courteous, proactive and comptent.

And now the long list of negatives - pathetic room decor, oddly positioned electric switch points, stained bedsheets, toilet flush issues, cobwebs on walls and ceilings, dark spots, and horror of horrors -  horrendous exterior walls bearing a dilapidated and rundown look that matched the theme of a play we watched in the evening - titled Wada Chirebandi (Old stone mansion)  We ordered chicken clear soup and pasta which was served after ages and worse, the chewy chicken made our dining experience a torture.  

This used to be a sterling landmark of Vile Parle once, now a godforsaken shadow of its former self. At any point in time, you find more staffers than guests and some of the former are rude buggers. My son had a guest and asked for some space in the lobby where they could chat for a while without disturbance and without having to order food. The receptionist was quick to nod her approval but once seated a gentlman appeared from nowhere and explicitly told them to leave the place if food was not on the agenda. It was a question of 10 minutes and what fuss he made and used a derogatory tone. The receptionist was apologetic but to no avail. Avoid this place like the plague. The single star is for Shyam Singhji.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r983034728-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,769,308386195,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/61/99/93/sudhir-r.jpg,769,74,212,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sudhirr390,Sudhir R,6E3E91069ECDD2A901F8A302C7960FD0,,304554,"Mumbai, India",Mumbai,sudhirr390,,General Manager,994294250,en,17-02-2025,Sunny Vanmali,"Dear Sir,

Rooms are not great, but then you get what you paid for. I stayed in Club Room, and there was no access to Club Lounge (now it's removed from their website after I bought it to their attention).

Room service charges. I had a guest, and I asked for two glasses (Rs. 50 per glass as a rent), ice bucket was Rs. 177. Water bottles were Rs. 50 (250 ml. Bottle, which I understand).

But Rs. 50 for an ordinary glass as a rent is ridiculous and Rs. 177 for ice bucket.

Helpful Mr. Joy !!,3,2019-04,19-05-2019,"I would like to acknowledge the Help rendered by Mr. Joy manning the hotel front desk. I somehow made a mistake of booking the hotel twice - one via expedia & one myself which I pre-paid. I forgot to cancel the expedia one & was automatically charged for that. In fact I did cancel but only a day before instead of 48 hours per the rules. After going back & forth a little, Mr Joy did help in arranging to get my refund back & I thank him for that.

Otherwise the hotel itself is just about okay. It's location being very near marine drive (walkable) is good.

While our room didn’t have a view of the Arabian Sea it was large, well lit, very clean and air conditioned with 2 ceiling fans. There is an elevator and round the clock security.

The staff are excellent and extremely helpful. Management is onsite round the clock and oversee the cleaning of the rooms etc. The hotel offers laundry and ironing services (no do it yourself facilities).

A Perfect blend,4,2018-09,02-10-2018,"We were driving to Mumbai for a few days for both work and relaxation. The destination Hotel was a usual one we drive to, where we had been staying for over the last few years whenever we were in town. The reason was that we always travel with our four legged Son our darling Beagle of ten years. As we were entering the suburbs we called up the hotel to convey the time of arrival, only to be told that that they had recently revised their pet policy and that they no longer permit pets on their property. Other than the fact that it was highly unprofessional of them to inform us at the last moment considering that they knew we were on our way and that we had a prior booking and they knew us very well as we were regulars, but that is another story. However, Indian mythology says whatever happens, happens for a good reason and so it was. We immediately started searching the web for pet friendly hotels and lo behold Chateau Windsor came up in our search. To be doubly sure we called up the property and we pleasantly greeted by the person from the property and advised that Yes our Pet was more than welcome there... Having said that we were a little skeptical on the kind of property as often pet friendly properties have much to be desired. Well we drove down to the property, which is very easy to find and beautifully located. The initial welcome by the guards was very encouraging, very friendly and hospitable and so caring towards the Pet too. We went up to the reception, which is on a upper floor, the lift attendant to was very polite though the lift itself was vintage, which is fine as it was functional... The reception area is very basic but functional. The hotel itself at the outset gave a very homely feeling and positive vibes. The reception staff was very helpful and we were shown a few rooms for our selection and to say the least we were pleasantly surprised to see the clean airy and fresh rooms. The toilets too are clean with hot and cold water on demand and clean linen to use. The building is a little old but reasonably well maintained, it seems that it  is a building which houses several flats which have been very efficiently carved out to form the existing hotel. Most rooms have a small balcony attached to it. no great view form the hotel itself but the location is fabulous and just a two minutes walk to get you the best views of the town. 
The Property is a little different in its functionality which I think I should amplify, though they have a functional kitchen they don't serve any full meals, only tea, coffee and a basic breakfast. But the good part is that they have several menus, in the room, of good eateries which deliver to the room and the hotel provides decent clean crockery and cutlery to make your meal a perfect one. they even serve it to you in your room in serving dishes if you would rather, Accessories like glasses and ice cubes are also available for those of us which want to make it an evening to remember. 
The Property is located close to all the modes of transport, A local metro station, Church gate, bus stops, Taxi stands and in the mobile age nothing is too far. The local shopping district, Colaba is five minutes drive, most tourist places this side of town are just a few minutes away, For those of us who are addicted to long walks and runs in the morning or evenings well then some of the best places to do the same are right round the corner. There are even some good eating places next to the property in-case you would rather go down for a meal or a change.  
We have since stayed at this places on several occasions and in different rooms and always been delighted by the hospitality. One of the few properties offering great value for money and the hospitality which beckons you to come back for more. So if its Mumbai with our Pet it would always be this place. 
Great show guys, would love to meet the owners and compliment them in person.

"Great location, good price",4,2017-12,12-01-2018,"I chose Chateau Windsor as our first port of call on a two week holiday in India which began in Mumbai. We didn’t want anything too fancy - just somewhere clean and well located. It ticked the boxes. It doesn’t look much from the outside, and the common areas are pretty ramshackle, so it was a pleasant surprise to find the room clean and comfortable.

WiFi was quite poor and unstable, and we needed to get a different username and password every day for each device, which was a bit annoying.

Reception is on the 5th floor, which makes collecting/leaving the room key a pain if you’re staying on the 1st floor - as we were. 

Breakfast is very simple - eggs, toast, jam, OJ, tea/coffee - but enough to set you up for the day.

All in all, an acceptable place for a few days in an excellent location at a good price.

The boon and Bane,3,2017-07,23-07-2017,"Well, it's quite an old hotel but rooms are very very well maintained. Yet to experience the age old things which perhaps, the frequent travellers or the ones looking for all-in-all won't appreciate too much. Let me talk about good things first. The location - near marine drive and pizza by the bay - our favorite places. A combination of old and middle age staff. That basic respect, safety - all ensured. Very nicely maintained rooms inspite of being very old hotel. The entrance is not grand at all though - if it makes a difference to you, to us it didn't. Just few recommendations - more stock of iron (we can't survive without it), a little more understanding for office going guests (you have to learn to deal and provide the requirements on time). The biggest flaw, inspite of good tariffs, is extremely poor breakfast. Buffet - don't dream of it. But even the options for in-room dining were almost negligible. This part really really needs to be catered to. If you are not a breakfast person, absolutely go for this place.

Lovely Hotel,4,2017-06,02-07-2017,My family have stayed at Chateau Windsor for many years & still do. Now it's tradition for my husband & myself when visiting India to stay here a few nights as well. Lovely hotel. It's clean & neat. Staff & office personnel are very accommodating. We always book a room here & the price always includes breakfast but honestly we've never had the breakfast here. They even have the newspaper for you in English. Most of their staff have been with them for many years. Remember the place is not 5*. It does not have a pool or a gym. It's comfortable & clean & neat. Location is perfect with a pizza place opposite then you have a fine dining indian restaurant diagonally opposite. You have a Burger King round the corner. Then you have ice cream places next to you. You could walk on marine drive at nite & feel safe.

We stayed here during our trip to Mumbai. One positive aspect was the security checking system at the entrance, which seemed well-organized. The check-in and check-out processes at the reception were also smooth and efficient.
However, there was no real sense of guest hospitality or welcoming culture. The rooms and in-room amenities were basic and not up to the standards expected from a star-rated hotel.
On a better note, the restaurant area was pleasant. Although the breakfast spread wasn’t very diverse, the food served was quite tasty.
To truly uphold the reputation of a star hotel, the management needs to make significant improvements — a sentiment echoed by many other guests in their reviews. Instead of offering scripted or generic responses, focusing on genuine service improvement would make a meaningful difference.

OMG!!!,1,2025-07,17-07-2025,"Good day everyone! I’ve been in this “beautiful” hotel on July 2025 and what I would like share to you is listed below:
1. Rooms condition- all of us (4 persons) have got identical rooms and all we have got the same problem- dirty room. So bath space corners are black because of mold. Bed sheet was with a black spot. Walls are cracked on corners.
2. Personnel- they are not as kind as they should be. 
3. Dining room- I’ve been surprised that the offered water was taken from faucet and there is nothing to drink else. So if you want to drink something like juice or Cola you have to pay extra money for that option. And you might be liked it but I am not, concerning food. So if you think that you will get different kind of food.. your thinks will be vanished by first breakfast. You have two options: hot and real hot. When I eat that food, I feel like my stomach is too infected and I really need to kill all infections inside.. say: “good bye” to your infections and enjoy visiting toilet on the next morning. Too hot for such morning…
4. When I open my window I have a real perfect option to see how all people on railway station (around of 15 meters distance) are looking to my naked body (leaving a part about other interesting things that they could see) after a shower… it’s so incredible! 
Now we are coming out of this “beautiful” hotel and we meet garbage station with plenty of garbage trucks around on hotel right side. It's making this hotel unbelievable. You can find a nice garbage river close to left side of hotel apartment as well. So I’ve only one question… Why it’s 4 stars? Who assigned it? My opinion is that it is necessary to remove all stars and put it back to usual hotels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d482013-r1019021402-Hotel_Kohinoor_Continental-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452387402,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,1200,0,1,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pioneer18740771828,Danila,86C305264C15193EF1E594B019D1B4FB,,1439536,"Khimki, Russia",Khimki,Pioneer18740771828,,manager,1019859790,en,21-07-2025,Hotel Kohinoor Continental,"Dear Danila,

Pleasant Stay,5,2025-05,02-06-2025,"We stayed at the hotel for a night. We availed the airport pick up and drop service as well. The hotel is very convenient to reach Mumbai International Airport. The staff is polite and helpful. We had dinner and breakfast at solitaire restaurant. The buffet spread was generous and starters were served at the table. The food quality was good. The dinner and breakfast both had live counters.

However it took a while and few reminders for our luggage to reach to our room. Also swimming pool was not operational.

Try and find another property at the same cost.,2,2024-08,30-08-2024,"I booked an Executive room on Agoda for 28th Aug. I had asked for one big bed and also a room in the main building. I called them up on the 28th aug to confirm both of these and they said yes. On arriving there at 3.30pm, the lady sitting at the Duty Managers desk, said they dont have any room on the main building but they can give me a room with two beds if I am ok. I said I had specifically asked for a big bed and I can wait if she wants to check. She then said that she will upgrade me a higher category room but on the other building. I said fine and got my room. The room that they gave me was surely not an upgrade. I have stayed in this property many times but not in the last 5 years and hence I know their kind of rooms. I did not have the strength to haggle. I went for a shower and the entire bathroom got flooded inspite of me having a shower in the shower cubicle. I had to call atleast 5 times to get them to send someone for housekeeping. The housekeeping guy said he has been telling them for long that he will need cement to seal up the place from where the water leaks. He cleaned the bathroom and left. Even the toilet seat was stained and spoilt inspite of them having put a sticker of 'sanitized'. The food I ordered was bad too. I ordered triple schezwan and they sent me some random noodles.

Хорошее местораположение,4,2017-04,14-05-2017,"Второй отель, в котором я остановился в Мумбае с учетом прошлых ошибок, произвел лучшее впечатление, чем предыдущее, но всегда есть своя ложка дегтя. Итак номер большой просторный чистый это большой плюс. Проблем с обслуживанием, постельным и прочим не было. Вроде бы все как в хорошей европейской 3ке, но ... до первого завтрака. Итак. Поднимаемся на крышу отеля и ... после полумрака отеля на раскаленном идийском солнце просто от боли жмурим глаза со всей силы. Возвращаемся в номер за очень темными очками. Ок так уже лучше. Для нас раскрывают зонтик и протирают пластиковый столик после чего официант готов принять заказ ... просто омлет или омлет масала (тоже но со специями и каплей овощей.) Выбираем второй вариант в надежде что он будет хоть не много сытнее. После этого вы получаете 2 тоста, масло джем, банан и чай/кофе на выбор. Поели прекрасно, готовьтесь через пару часов искать место для обеда. Зато каждое утро на ручке дверей в тканевом мешочке вас будет ждать свежая газета (на английском) И еще маленький штрих ресепшен расположен на последнем этаже так что с чемодан придется несколько раз придется прокатиться туда сюда в маленьком неуютном старом лифте. Бонусы рядом прекрасная набережная с великолепным закатом и на углу прекрасный ""итальянский ресторан"", где ризотто падают в тарелке из которой мы обычно едим суп/борщ :).

Decent Hotel beware the Taxis outside,3,2017-03,26-04-2017,"The hotel is budget but that's not a bad thing. It is decent, rooms are clean, well equipped (electronic safe, shower, table, TV, plugpoints) with (noisy but effective) AC. Good value for money, but I would not spend any more.  

Having no lobby can be a deal breaker for some, as it keeps you from meeting others and makes the corridors noisy. Chunky room keys that must be deposited with reception is burdensome and very old fashioned. Free internet has to be renewed by reception every day or so.

Biggest negative as a nervous traveller is the taxis that wait outside the hotel. Most taxis flagged down in Mumbai are fine, but these parked ones overcharge, refuse to go short distances, don't use their meters and apply pressure. The fact that hotel staff direct you to them makes me think they work with the hotel (or its staff). You will find yourself avoiding the hotel staff at the door in order to avoid taking their favoured taxis!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r479094516-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452390771,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,1200,3,3,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MumbaiDavey,MumbaiDavey,96C93661472456F77B8C9B4A68FAE209,,186338,"London, United Kingdom",London,MumbaiDavey,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

Good on location,4,2017-04,14-04-2017,"I visited Mumbai last week with my parents and grandparents. The location of the hotel is quite good and probably the best deal for a budget hotel in the area. It's a predominantly a budgeted old school hotel with spacious and neat n clean rooms. I hv done a lot of travelling in the last few yrs and this hotel comes nowhere near to the modern resorts in terms of luxury and amenities. 
One drawback of the hotel is that it doesnt have its own restaurant. One needs to order food from the nearby restaurants and the hotel pantry staff is pleased to serve the food in the room. They are offering complementary b/fast, but that however is limited to either eggs (boiled/scrambled/poached/omlette) or veg cutlet (any one) along with only 2 slices of bread and a cup of tea/coffee.

Good Hotel at Great Location.,4,2017-03,28-03-2017,"I visited this hotel twice within the month if march 2017 during a family tour of Mumbai-Konkan-Goa-Mumbai. This hotel is excellent in terms of the following.

1. Rooms and large and very clean.
2. Hotel is professionally managed.
3. Staffs are very friendly, courteous and reliable.
4. Room service is prompt
5. Each roomis having a secure electronic locker. You can keep important documents there and relax.
6. This hotel is at a walking distance from marine lines. All major destinations are walkable.

Scope of improvement.
1.Breakfast is monotonous and boring after few days.

Would definitely come back to this hotel!,4,2017-02,05-03-2017,"My decision to book in advance 4 nights at Chateau Windsor hotel was not much better than a shot in the dark. However, it quickly turned out after check-in that the choice was a good one, so I extended my stay after 2 nights until my departure from Mumbai 10 days later.

By Mumbai standards, the hotel is reasonably priced, and has an excellent location for sightseeing and exploration of South Mumbai.

It's only a stone's throw from Marine Drive running along the bay which can be seen from the hotel's rooftop terrace used for serving breakfasts.

Churchgate train station is a short walking distance (approx. 5 minutes) away from the hotel, and the famous Gateway of India monument is about 25-30 minutes on foot.

Chateau Windsor does not have its own restaurant, but there are two excellent restaurants in the same street nearby- Kamling (Chinese) and Gaylord (Indian).

My room on the 4th floor of the hotel was delightful, tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean.

The hotel staff is generally courteous and helpful. However, if some special assistance is needed, I suggest that you approach directly Mr Ramesh in reception- he is most knowledgeable and obliging.

Stayed at Chateau Windsor hotel in February 2017.

My tip for travellers to India: If you really want to have hassle-free travel in this country, be always alert, but go with the flow- regardless of your circumstances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r464706396-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452389741,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,1200,4,4,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karelu_11,karel u,0E6E7F2DF4D9D5A65B5435E9E3327E09,,255068,"Brisbane, Australia",Brisbane,karelu_11,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
"Clean, helpful staff, convenient location",4,2017-02,03-03-2017,"We stayed here for twelve nights in February during the Kala Ghoda Festival.  Our third floor room was very spacious and spotlessly clean.  The private bathroom was not an ensuite but separate from the bedroom, and accessed with a key.  Although this was a slight inconvenience at night, the decent water pressure and reliable hot shower compensated.  Again, the bathroom was always clean.  
Breakfast on the roof terrace was basic eggs and toast, a banana, and tea or coffee.  This was perfectly fine though rather monotonous by the twelfth morning😊
All staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay.  I was able to print documents in the office for a modest fee.  
Another plus was the laundry service.  Our clothes were returned ironed with knife-edge creases and white paper folded into shirts and dresses to keep them perfect.  What a pleasure! 
The only downside to the stay was that smokers often occupied adjacent rooms.  Perhaps smokers could be restricted to one floor and non-smokers to another?
We chose the hotel for price and location.  Very close to Marine Parade, Churchgate station, several good restaurants, and right across the street from Rustoms ice cream shop, Chateau Windsor is also extremely handy for anyone wanting to access Colaba, Kala Ghoda, Fort, Marine Lines, or Kemp's Corner.

Highly recommend and value for money ,5,2024-02,17-02-2024,"Hotel Parle International stands out for its good standards of cleanliness. 
Front office staff are very nice and friendly.
They pay attention to your needs and respond spontaneously.
Faizal Sir, the duty manager has a pleasant personality. He gladly sorted for our two rooms to be close by. From front office Rohit Sir and Sachin Sir are also very helpful. 
The transfer from and to the airport has been perfectly arranged. Grateful to the staff who waited to pick us as it takes over an hour to clear immigration and collect lugguage from the airport. 
Ashok Das and Mithun from housekeeping did a great job to uphold the cleanliness of the room. Towels and sheets were changed daily. Got fresh flowers and fruits in room.
The rooms are spacious and well-maintained, promising a comfortable stay. 
Antony Sir and Madhuri Ma'am from the restaurant have been very attentive to our needs. Mansoor Musafir makes the best best best dosa in the world. 
The gym is great with the basic amenities allowing a good workout during the stay. However,  access to a phone would be great since the gym is in the basement.
With its commitment to exceptional service and attention to detail, Hotel Parle International guarantees a delightful and rejuvenating stay for travelers.
Nestled in the centre of Vile Parle, all amenities are walking distance from the Hotel.

Poor Stay ,1,2022-11,23-10-2023,"
Landed in Mumbai, India for the first time as a family trip last spring of May 2022. Im reposting this review as I noticed my last years post was not cut an didn't include the full detail of our stay.  To make everything short I will share the good side and the bad side of our stay. My reviews is about this hotel that we stayed in. Starting from the good side, wifi  was pretty much stable and no interruption in internet connection you can surf with ease. Distance from the airport by rental car was 15 minutes and if you opted for a  public transportation (toktok or autorickshaw) it’ll take you  about 30 minutes to reached it. However, the bad side of our stay is far beyond our expectations. We pre arrange everything to the hotel and as they mentioned and as what normally hotel would do is to provide a driver with signage board with names of the passengers at the arrival area. We then reached the airport at 00:10 hrs midnight and took us around few minutes to finally passed the immigration and yes we finally  made it out to the arrival area. Following scenarios are really unexpected.We waited long time for the driver after we came out from the airport. Frustrated and devastated because no one was there for us. Needless to say but I have to let you know that we are tired and exhausted from travel and all we want is to get to the hotel to take rest. Despite of the humid weather outside the airport we still look and searched for our names and still we didn’t lose hope looking for the driver. We were indeed desperate and started to lose our patience until someone step-in to helped us contact the hotel. Someone answered the phone and to our surprised he was not  aware that we’ve been waiting for long time already at the airport and what’s confusing is they sent the driver early that night. Instead of waiting at the airport, the driver  spent his time sleeping at the parking area only with no sense of responsibility and almost forgot that we are already waiting for him for 2 hours. Imagine? The driver then came and showed up after 2 hours in an irritable mood with no greetings as he just asked our name. No apologies made and was obviously bothered as we saw his face from from sleep. He didn’t picked up our bags and told us only to follow him to the parking area.  We then reached the hotel around 02:30 hrs and there was one guy outside the hotel simply standing with no initiative that he got work to do. No signs of customer service and effort to greet the guest and worst didn’t helped carry our bags while it was very obvious that we need helped so we  ended up dragging our bags towards the reception.The receptionist on-duty that night  was not customer service as well  and was not accommodated. We asked him why we weren’t picked early from the airport? Instead he makes a lot of  excuses and lies on why were picked late.  He told us that the driver came at 23:55 hrs but why he let us waited for 2 hours?  Illogical reason.While at the reception, we  didn’t feel we are welcome as no greetings made and the receptionist guy is not really in a position to deal with guest. As we were escorted to our rooms, we noticed the passage way/lobby was very smelly and it was really strong like it emanated from the sewage and lots of bed mattresses  kept along the sides of  the hallway near to the doors. I have so much to say regarding our room hygiene. The phone was visibly dirty and dusty, pillow covers (picture attached) with obvious stained as it looks like it was flipped down  and was not changed for long time and was not washed.  Bathroom was dirty and the toilet sit bowls was obviously messy.  Without any disposable tissues as well. Really frustrating. We then called the reception and It took long time to attend for our needs and waited  to get our beds to get ready and making sure its clean  before we lie down to rest. Took really long time to wait in getting rid of the dirty beddings, we also asked to change our bath towels as it has yellowish stained. We then only sleep at around 03:30 in the morning we only started sleeping. Finally, at the time of our check out, our bags are ready and 2 helper guys were just simply standing at the lobby and no one dared to help us to  bring our bags outside the hotel. This is such an awful experience and frustrating hotel service. This is the first time and  the last time we will be staying in this hotel. Not recommendable. You better see it by yourself and try for this once in a last time experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r922598821-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,849,715627808,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/a7/9d/20/lancetrevor.jpg,849,10,52,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lancetrevor,Лэнс Л,106D5D02C45F2B48EF61D74E36440A96,,295424,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dubai,lancetrevor,,General Manager,966809038,en,26-08-2024,Sunny Vanmali,"Dear Esteemed Guest, Warm Greetings!

Then the duty manager gave us a suite rather a regular room to compensate for our missing dinner included in the booking at this hotel but then allowed us have free dinner the following date anyway.

The location couldn’t be more convenient — just minutes from the terminal with a reliable, free shuttle service that runs on time. Check-in was smooth and efficient, even during late hours.

The room was clean, quiet, and well-appointed, with a very comfortable bed and curtains that made it easy to rest after a long flight. I especially appreciated the soundproofing — I barely heard any noise.

Staff were friendly, professional, and helpful with recommendations and arranging transportation. The on-site restaurant had a solid menu with good quality food, perfect if you’re too tired to venture out.

Convenient for airport,4,2025-02,03-02-2025,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights on arrival in Mumbai. It is really convenient for the airport which was great. The other positives are the Solitaire Restaurant where the staff were very friendly and helpful and the food absolutley delicious if slightly on the pricey side for India but we expect this in an hotel. Our room was spacious and well equipped with a fridge, kettle with plenty of tea and coffee and air con. There is also a safe and a hairdryer. On a less positive note it is tired looking and really could do with a lick of paint. The pool looked really lovely and there is a shower room with towels provided but sadly no place to sit around the pool which was disappointing as we had a free afternoon  on arrival and would have loved to relax around the pool but couldn't. There was a lack of information in the room about where things are, timings etc which could be improved. We tried to go for a pre dinner drink in the bar but were told we couldn't and needed to go to the restaurant. This may have been because there was an engagement one day and a wedding the next so perhaps the bar is reserved for those guests but not great. Finally my biggest gripe was that breakfast was included but we slept in and just had time for a coffee before our tour began. There was only milky coffee available, when I asked for a black coffee I was told I would have to pay extra. I didn't want an espresso just a cup of coffee without milk. I spoke to the front desk and they said they should have brought me one from the kitchen so possibly the person I asked was unaware but I was really annoyed and didn't get a coffee as didn't have time to go back. All in all a great hotel for a short stay in Mumbai.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d482013-r992160851-Hotel_Kohinoor_Continental-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452387345,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,1200,14,140,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596moirar,Moira R,3E4A3EE72F7B6A09B704D9DDDC6B5CA5,,,,,596moirar,,manager,992172239,en,04-02-2025,Hotel Kohinoor Continental,"Dear Moira,

One of the highlights was the buffet breakfast, which provided a wide variety of delicious options to start the day right. The dinner buffet was equally amazing, offering an impressive selection of dishes that cater to different tastes.

The rooms were spotlessly clean and well-maintained, which added to the overall comfort of my stay. I must also commend the courteous and attentive staff, especially Namrata and Ameya, who went out of their way to ensure that I had everything I needed.

Hotel Experience,1,2022-05,13-06-2022,"Landed in Mumbai, India for the first time as a family trip. To make everything short I will share the good side and the bad side of our stay. My reviews is about this hotel that we stayed in. Starting from the good side, wifi  was pretty much stable and no interruption in internet connection you can surf with ease. Distance from the airport by rental car was 15 minutes and if you opted for a  public transportation (toktok or autorickshaw) it’ll take you  about 30 minutes to reached it. However, the bad side of our stay is far beyond our expectations. We pre arrange everything to the hotel and as they mentioned and as what normally hotel would do is to provide a driver with signage board with names of the passengers at the arrival area. We then reached the airport at 00:10 hrs midnight and took us around few minutes to finally passed the immigration and yes we finally  made it out to the arrival area.Following scenarios are really unexpected.We waited long time for the driver after we came out from the airport. Frustrated and devastated because no one was there for us. Needless to say but I have to let you know that we are tired and exhausted from travel and all we want is to get to the hotel to take rest. Despite of the humid weather outside the airport we still look and searched for our names and still we didn’t lose hope looking for the driver. We were indeed desperate and started to lose our patience until someone step-in to helped us contact the hotel. Someone answered the phone and to our surprised he was not  aware that we’ve been waiting for long time already at the airport and what’s confusing is they sent the driver early that night. Instead of waiting at the airport, the driver  spent his time sleeping at the parking area only with no sense of responsibility and almost forgot that we are already waiting for him for 2 hours. Imagine? The driver then came and showed up after 2 hours in an irritable mood with no greetings as he just asked our name. No apologies made and was obviously bothered as we saw his face from from sleep. He didn’t picked up our bags and told us only to follow him to the parking area.  We then reached the hotel around 02:30 hrs and there was one guy outside the hotel simply standing with no initiative that he got work to do. No signs of customer service and effort to greet the guest and worst didn’t helped carry our bags while it was very obvious that we need helped so we  ended up dragging our bags towards the reception.The receptionist on-duty that night  was not customer service as well  and was not accommodated. We asked him why we weren’t picked early from the airport? Instead he makes a lot of  excuses and lies on why were picked late.  He told us that the driver came at 23:55 hrs but why he let us waited for 2 hours?  Illogical reason.While at the reception, we  didn’t feel we are welcome as no greetings made and the receptionist guy is not really in a position to deal with guest. As we were escorted to our rooms, we noticed the passage way/lobby was very smelly and it was really strong like it emanated from the sewage and lots of bed mattresses  kept along the sides of  the hallway near to the doors. I have so much to say regarding our room hygiene. The phone was visibly dirty and dusty, pillow covers with obvious stained as it looks like it was flipped down  and was not changed for long time and was not washed.  Bathroom was dirty and the toilet sit bowls was obviously messy.  Without any disposable tissues as well. Really frustrating. We then called the reception and It took long time to attend for our needs and waited  to get our beds to get ready and making sure its clean  before we lie down to rest. Took really long time to wait in getting rid of the dirty beddings, we also asked to change our bath towels as it has yellowish stained. We then only sleep at around 03:30 in the morning we only started sleeping. Finally, at the time of our check out, our bags are ready and 2 helper guys were just simply standing at the lobby and no one dared to help us to  bring our bags outside the hotel. This is such an awful experience and frustrating hotel service. This is the first time and  the last time we will be staying in this hotel. Not recommendable. You better see it by yourself and try for this once in a last time experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r842720225-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,849,715627808,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/a7/9d/20/lancetrevor.jpg,849,10,52,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lancetrevor,Лэнс Л,106D5D02C45F2B48EF61D74E36440A96,,295424,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dubai,lancetrevor,,,,,,,,"B.N.

Good Hotel with some scope for improvements,3,2021-12,13-01-2022,"The location of the hotel is good and very convenient. The room was quite specious and reasonably clean. The Window A/C of the room was old and very noisy. Electric Kettle was provided but, tea bags, sugar etc was not replenished during house keeping. The Shower worked but shower curtain was missing, resulting in splashing of water all over the bathroom. Bucket and mug was provided but water tap was not working. I think a little attention to these small issues can make the stay comfortable.  The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. I hope the hotel management will take a note of this feedback in the right spirit.

PATHETIC HOTEL AND EQUALLY RUDE STAFF,1,2021-12,02-12-2021,"We checked into the hotel on the 1st of December’21.
Had booked a club room(a higher catogory room) but was checked into an executive room(the regular basic room).
On asking for it was shown to another room.
The lock wasn’t working in it.
Each time we moved out and came back to our room…the lick would get stuck and we would have to call the hotel staff for help.
To which they would say that we don’t  know how to operate the lock!!!to be noted that even the hotel staff would struggle to open it each  time.
The staff at the reception was so so rude towards us in front of so many other guests.
The rooms are unhygienic…even in covid times(omnicom strain times),there are no safety protocols that are being followed.
Not even a basic sanitizer is being provided in the room!
The staff is with  their masks under their chins.
The food being served in the dining  is cold and unhygienic.
Overall a very very disappointing experience and not worth a single star!
I wish there was a negative rating as well!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r820758904-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452388900,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/24/default-avatar-2020-60.jpg,1200,10,6,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ritujain97,Ritu J,66B482DABF631EFB1A1A11223A388B6E,,,,,Ritujain97,,,,,,,,"B.N.

High price & low service,2,2020-07,19-07-2020,I was staying in the hotel for the quarantine for 7 days. I selected this hotel because it's near to my house. Category on Google is 4 star but service is like 2 star. Firstly bad smell in rooms & corridor. No refrigerator in the room. Room was smelling really bed when I entered. No hot water switch for the bathing. Toilet cammod very dirty. 2nd day when I took bath all water bloged in the bathtub. When I told the below reception area they are like it will go automatically but it didn't. I had to call twice then they send some technical team. They don't have room service that's fine. But when I am ordering from swiggy or zomato they are telling me come down & take it. Atleast hotel people can do that. When I keeping dustbin out to clean they are just taking trash and they were not changing the bean bag also. No cleaning rooms until 7 days of stay. Only good thing about this hotel is food. Not that good but then it's fine. 1st & 2nd day I got food on time otherwise 1/2 hour - 1hour late always. Please as per the rates you need to upgrade your services. Hotel stinks a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r760646926-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,,,,,0,2,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saylaak,Sayli K,B7F1618AAD7E05950A51FF19C1C17921,,295424,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dubai,Saylaak,,Revenue Management,774238600,en,13-10-2020,Sunny Vanmali,"Dear Valued Guest,

Rude and unhelpful and overpriced,2,2020-01,22-04-2020,"Was a stopover in Mumbai and so chose this hotel. Had arrived in early hours of the morning. Went and had breakfast and decided to get some sleep. All of a sudden there was drilling and hammering. Was not told on arrival  or when booking that they were going to carry out refurbishment. Didn't get any rest till night. How terrible !!! The next day the breakfast area was moved and no one to guide you. The AC was very old with half of the flaps damaged or missing. The bedsheets were roughly stitched over were the big tears had occurred. Cleaners have there own temperament. None of the staff from reception to cleaners ever smile. No one wishes good morning or bye. Do they think that we don't have other options??? They must be kidding themselves as Mumbai has many hotels and some budget hotels I found were much nicer in everything from staff behaviour, ambience to helpfulness. Would not recommend this hotel unless none of the above makes no difference. I have my pride and respect which no one has right to insult.

Comfortable and good location,4,2016-12,16-12-2016,"On arrival, 7 hours before checkin, I was given a small single room to freshen up and grab some sleep. I was offered complimentary tea, coffee, or beer! This was something they did not have to do, but did none the less. Very kind of them. Although the room was a bit rough, it had air con and was very welcome. When I got my room, it was just what I needed. Clean, nice comfortable bet, good air con and fan. The bathroom was a wet room, though the showers temperature control was a bit hit and miss it was fine. The room was also large, I felt very comfortable for my week. The hotel is old fashioned in look, but has lots of character. I especially liked the old lift, always atttended and quite a piece of machinery. It was not loud at all, and my room was near it. Breakfast was limited, but fine for me with eggs or veg cutlet toast, jam, banana, tea or coffee. What made it great was having it on the roof terrace watching the sunrise. A really lovely spot to start the day. I really loved looking at the various plants being grown, including Produce such as Okra, spinach, courgettes, and figs! No restaurant, but room service does good snacks e.g. Sandwiches, omelettes etc. You can order food from local restaurants and have them delivered. It's good to have these on the terrace, with a beer. The hotel will sell you beer, even though it's not on the menu. The hotel is surprisingly quiet, being so central. I had not one bad nights sleep. The staff were all lovely, especially the door staff who were such a laugh! They were very keen to help with taxis etc. The 'management' could be a bit abrasive, but this did not ruin anything. It bacame a bit of a joke how they like to throw their weight about a bit. My room was cleaned each day, and the hotel is indeed nice and clean. I had no bouts of upset stomach all week. Not many negatives, but the hotel could have perhaps been a bit more helpful when we were having trouble getting cash, due to the 500 and 1000 rupee withdrawals and the chaos thereafter. Price was good considering the fine location near marine drive and the comfort of the rooms. I would recommend you pay a little extra for the deluxe rooms, saw an older room and the was not as good. Myself and the people I travelled with would definitely reccommend this hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r444707675-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1936,63725888,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/cc/61/40/bsimo.jpg,2592,33,67,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BSIMO,BSIMO,478892B3F57313DA1B523359BA81E686,,,,,BSIMO,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

It is very close to the sea (by walking 1-2 minutes) as well as form Churchgate Station. You can get view of Brabourne Stadium from your balcony. There are plenty of eating / shopping option nearby and you can go to nearby tourist spots like colaba, Gateway of India, marine drive etc by walking.

good midrange at great location,4,2016-11,13-11-2016,"a stone's throw from Marine Drive, this small hotel proved to be a good base for a few days in south Mumbai.

Deluxe room was nice and clean enough, the mattress seemed a bit old, the aircon has seen better days; bathroom was ok and clean

Reception was a bit odd, a lot of different faces over the few days I stayed here, but always helpful, if not overly friendly, but that may just be Mumbai briskness

Breakfast in-room only, basic yet sufficient, to be enjoyed by, what I regard as a nice, complimentary daily Indian newspaper

Location, as said before, is good; there's a few restaurants nearby, among which a terrific veg restaurant, Shiv Sagar; look for the crowd of people waiting to get seated, it is popular, for a reason; a (rather bland) Chinese one (Kamling) if you got Mumbai-belly problems and a more upmarket one (Gaylord, across the street and over the fence) if you want to play safe or splurge a bit; Churchgate station is just a few minutes walk

Colaba is a stiff 10-minute walk, through some rather nice and interesting streets, but outside there're lots of taxis that will take you there for a dime

Not our kind of place,2,2016-10,14-10-2016,"The rain was pouring down and we found ourselves in a hotel with no common areas at all.

The mattress was the thinnest we have ever seen in a hotel og b&b before and after to nights my back complained. I am surprised to see how high rating this hotel has got in some web pages, but after being there I guess it fits local male business people well.

Great Location,3,2016-04,17-04-2016,"The Chateau Windsor, where I stayed for 2 nights on a sudden business trip last week, is not a conventional hotel. As the photographs clearly show, it is a block of apartments converted to a guest house. There's a liftman to greet you as you step off the road, and whisk you up to the 5th floor where you check in at a quaint little reception room, and can almost expect to see an old epabx board with wires:-) You sign in to a large register and are given a heavy key.

I was shown in to a room on the 2nd floor which was very clean, with a nice little balcony overlooking the road outside. The toilet was very clean too, and the airconditioning worked alright. 

The amenities are minimal, which can perhaps be expected because this is very much a budget hotel. This means you will need to carry your own soap, shampoo etc. Instead of a bath mat there is a little piece of astroturf to absorb the water. However clean towels are provided.

The Chateau Windsor has no restaurants but will bring the complimentary breakfast to your room in around 15 minutes. They will also bring you any food you may order from the variety of menu cards of nearby hotels, placed in your room. The comlimentary wi fi did not work on my laptop or mobile and a call to the recepton yielded nothing more than 'I will call you back,' and no such call came.

The staff were courteous until my son accidentally stepped out with the room key and I had to request a master key to let myself in. They made their displeasure visible, and opened my room but refused to leave the duplicate key so the room remained in darkness and I could only manage to see anything by leaving the door wide open. Fortunately I only needed 2 minutes to pick up something and leave. I cannot blame them really because they may have been worried I will walk off with the duplicate too!

In terms of security, it may feel a little scary for single women, although I did not see anything to support that view. Just that it does not have the usual trappings of a hotel, with a door man/ reception/ security which can stop non-residents from entering, and which we, perhaps foolishly, imagine is security enough:-) If my adult son was not staying with me I may have considered moving out after seeing the place.

The best feature of the hotel and what makes it a great place of course is its location. Barely 2/3 minutes away from the Marine Drive, where you can take long leisurely walks and take in the sea breeze, after a hectic day at work. It is also within 15 minutes walking distance of the Churchgate train station.

Al in all the stay was not bad. Would I stay there again, perhaps if I had to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r365007661-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,709,134846341,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/09/97/85/missybuddy37.jpg,709,36,97,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissyBuddy2,MissyBuddy2,BF6BE73F7CCA3AED31CFCE1D30997F14,,297676,"Coonoor, India",Coonoor,MissyBuddy2,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
Ok value for money but grim hotel,3,2016-04,16-04-2016,"Stayed a few nights here, location is good only few miles from the sights of south mumbai and no issues with noise, the price is why we chose the hotel it is good value for the location

Taxi drivers cant find if you have to say the ambassador hotel which is next door

Rooms were clean, breakfast ok and delivered to the room as no eating area.  However the hotel is worn down, small and depressing place to come back to at the end of the day, but ok for a night or two just to sleep.  No restaurent/bar or area to chill and lift is manually operated.  Staff were friendly 

However i would personally recommend spending a few extra rupees and staying somewhere nicer, would not stay again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r364624169-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,385,96474726,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/c0/16/66/kesh-n.jpg,536,43,439,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Londontravel9,Neil,BF8E65414C6828F76016B77F36AEAF90,,2549055,"Beckenham, United Kingdom",Beckenham,Londontravel9,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
God hotel and in good area,3,2016-04,11-04-2016,"The hotel is good, and getting a bit worn out, so management needs to start some improvement works as some items have reached their end of life. But it is situated in a very good area, so at walking distances from the beach, Churchgate and even the gateway to India. 
And, very important: management will make facilities available in the afternoon/evening for those wanting to take a shower or go to toilet before going to the Airport - a very appreciated service. Breakfast is relatively simpel, although the roof terrace might needs some improvement (now it's a plain terrace with some tables and some chairs, not very inviting to have a bit longer stay).

The hotel is very close to the waterfront and only a short walk away from Churchgate Railway station. We stayed in this area because we were attending a cricket match at Wankhede Stadium which is also within easy walking distance.
Hotels in this area are quite a way from the Airport which can be a nuisance when the traffic is bad.

High Price Low maintenance- Big Name but false Fame,3,2019-08,31-08-2019,"This was the last minute booking that was made on 22nd August this year. However one thing was satisfactory that they had the rooms available. 
However, just to realise the rooms would be available anyhow as the location of the hotel is not very much in demand, hence rooms should be available in the last minute as well. It states itself as a 3star hotel, however I would rate it as a 2star only.

Few Pros and Cons about the hotel:
Pros:
The room service is 24/7 and is very responsive : 5/5
House Keeping: 5/5
Hotel Maintenance :4/5
Most of the staff are courteous and they listen to you.
Near the local market, where everything is accessible.

Cons:
Hotel is too old: 3/5
The furniture, the walls and the interiors need a repair or get renovated: 3/5
Buffet breakfast doesn't have good options : 2/5
I could see the same breakfast buffet everyday in my 4days of stay: 1/5
Seating area near the buffet section is very small, it can hardly accommodate 30-35 if you share your table with others : 2/5
Walls inside need to be painted: 3/5
The head rest and the sofas need to be changed as someone can feel the springs when you sit on the sofa: 1/5
No Hot water inside the rooms(We had to call the technician to get it fixed for oneday, the other days, we managed with the luke warm water): 2/5
No proper toiletries placed: 3/5
Hairdryer doesn't get fixed on the stand: 3/5
No Minifridge inside the room as shown in the amenities: 0/5
Wifi is literally very slow, it is equal to having a no WiFi; 1/5
No Safe provided: 0/5

Wonderful Stay. Ideal location. Great Services,4,2019-03,09-03-2019,"Extremely impressed with the hotel facilities. Big rooms and very courteous staff. I reached a bit early than my check in time but the reception staff was very quick to get my room ready after realizing that I was travelling with small kids. They gave me a nice spacious room as well. 

Pros
1. Chef was amazing. Made sure that milk for kids is made complimentary and informed the manager 
at reception to take care of it throughout our stay. These small gestures makes a customer come back to them.

2. Good location. Close to Juhu Chaupati. Location is in heart of market area if one is new to Mumbai and wishes to explore local market

Old but comfortable Hotel,3,2019-01,21-02-2019,"Stayed at the Villa Parle International for one night in January 2019 as part of a stop over - The hotel is centrally located nearby the markets and arcades with stores, which was convenient, and is also not far from the Mumbai airport. 

We were given a room at first in a building opposite the main hotel but due to the building being isolated (Nothing was wrong with the room - If anything, it was more spacious) but as 2 ladies travelling together, there was nobody else occupying a room in the building, with only the security guard on the ground floor, so we asked for a room in the main hotel where there was more activity. 

The main hotel seems to be beautifully decorated but old, and it seems like they are in the process of undergoing repairs. We were provided with a simple, clean room. If you require a hot shower, I suggest ensuring that the geyser is switched on. Breakfast was a simple affair, but tasty. Wifi was very good. It's a nice hotel to stay at for a stop over.

Highly recommend that you eat the Thali at the hotel's restaurant.

Room was cozy and spacious .
Bathroom was clean .

Avoidable ,1,2019-02,08-02-2019,"The hotel has 3 buildings connected to each other. One is new rest of the two are old. On the website, pictures of new portion are shown, while old rooms are allotted with the charges of new rooms. 

The good: 
1. Rooms are clean. 
2. Close to Vile Parle station 

The bad: 
1. Small rooms. 
2. Badly maintained 
3. No window in the room. 
4. Exorbitantly priced 
5. Old fixtures, door handles wooden parts are not clean. 
6. Rubber grommets in the lift door are gone. The protruding screws scratch the passenger. 
7. The ambience doesn’t feel fresh. 
8. Commode is small and not of good quality. 
9. Kettle needs to be clean from outside and inside with clean water 

Conclusion: 
Stay only if you get a tariff below 3000 INR per night. This hotel is not worth more than that. 

The pictures posted on website are from the newly constructed portion. The new rooms are allotted only when old building is full. 

So insist on getting new room, better don’t make an advance payment for this property coz u may get stuck with old rooms like me. 

Housekeeping staff is good and supportive. The front desk seemed aloof.

You must try his LIIT  , Apple berry. 

Tandoori Sea food is highly recommended. 

Tandoori Pomfret, Tandoori Prawns, Mutton Nihari, Creme Bruelle are a must try and super delicious.

Highlight of the hotel is the electrifying performance by Mr Raymond and his team.
Super talented singers and lovely live music.
One of the best performances ever.

Impecable Hospitality of staff is worth a mention. All the staff are amiable and treated us very well.

Bad experience with Rutika and Azad.,1,2023-09,04-09-2023,"I was on my business stay and my company paid for all my expenses. As the stay was in my known city I called up a family member to meet and I’ve been staying for business trips in hotels since 2015, even the biggest hotel chains like Raddison, Novotel, IBIS etc have never created an issue of calling a family member. However people at Kohinoor are pathetic and didn’t allow any guests and I was being told that as my company is paying  I’m not allowed to bring any guest. I’ve never heard this in any hotel.

Great Location,4,2016-02,13-03-2016,"We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel during our tour of Mumbai. The hotel is located only a 5 minute walk from the Churchgate railway station and less than 5 minute walk to the scenic Marine Drive. The area around the hotel is pedestrian friendly, lots of shops and restaurants nearby. At night one can walk on the marine drive and it is safe. This is a modest hotel, the reception is on the 5th floor, there is no lobby. We had the only room available on the top floor at the roof top terrace. With the room you get a private sitting area surrounded by garden of potted plants. Marine drive can be seen from the terrace and on a good day catch beautiful sunset. The rest of the terrace has beautiful plants/flowers as well and is used to serve breakfast to the hotel guests. There is no restaurant, there is limited menu including eggs/toast/tea which is served in the room or on the veranda. The room is compact, the bathroom is tight but manageable, we did not spend much time in the room as we were out sightseeing until late at night.

"Clean hotel, perfect location, excellent staff",5,2016-02,17-02-2016,"We booked a room for 3 for one week.  The room was basic, but large and very clean.  The price was great and we were not expecting anything fancy.  The location was ideal for us, a very short walk to Churchgate station, a stones throw from Marine drive and a short taxi ride to Colaba or Crawford Market ways. 
The wifi was perfect and strong, never cut out once and automatically connected as soon as we stepped into the lift.
The one thing that stood out about this hotel was the staff, they were absolutely wonderful.  We were going to stay in another hotel the next week, but instead decided to re-book here for another week.  If you are looking for luxury then this is not a luxury hotel, but then that is reflected in the price.

Outstanding service greatly compensates for dated amenities,4,2016-01,30-01-2016,"- Main reason to stay at Chateau Windsor would be the staff and management who are extremely friendly and helpful. They'll bend over backwards to help customers. It was our first trip in India and we were having problems with our train reservations being wait-listed. They told us exactly were to go (up to even the ticket reservation counter number where tourist quotas are handled) and what to ask for at the nearby Churchgate Station to get our train tickets confirmed and, when our Mumbai-Goa train journey could not be confirmed, arranged to book plane tickets for us at a very reason able fare.

Business Hotel but Not Recommended for single female travellers,3,2015-12,26-01-2016,"The best thing I liked about this hotel was the location(its located very near to the sea).
The staff was polite.
Very average breakfast. In my four days stay - I had it only once.
The hotel does has its only restaurant to serve lunch or dinner; they have kept brochures of restaurant around which you can order from.
I booked this hotel as it was near to the exhibition place where I had to go. On arriving I was shocked seeing the room(I had booked a standard room); but definitely it was not worth paying more than Rs500. I thought of leaving but the money was given before and they would not refund. The staff pitched in and offered a better room but with extra cost - To which I agreed. This room was much better(at-least) matching to what is shown in the pictures).

Rip off - I do not recommend ,2,2016-01,24-01-2016,"This hotel was a combination of the worst and most expensive we stayed at in India.
The nicer rooms they show you online do not have ensuite bathrooms, you have to cross the public hall to use your bathroom. The rooms with ensuite bathrooms are terrible. They are loud. The bathroom windows do not close (slats) and the room windows are fogged out. Felt like a prison. We still chose that room because we preferred ensuite bathroom but it was a terrible room.
The breakfast was very lame, worst out of all the hotels we stayed at in India (we stayed in 15) and the only one that did not provide bottled water with the room.
Further more, they did not provide top sheets for the bed.
To top it off, the showers were luke warm at their hottest.
I do not recommend it unless you can pay $40 a night or less for a room (I paid $150). It was in a good location and it was not dirty, so for a low price I would consider it, but In retrospect I should have paid a little bit more for one of the nicer hotels nearby, as this hotel had the worst bang for the buck of any hotel I have stayed at world wide.

Stopover in Mumbai,1,2018-10,30-10-2018,"Apart from being in close proximity to the airport and shopping area there is very little this hotel can offer. It is dated and dirty, when we checked in we were given a twin room when we had paid for a double, they called it an upgrade I dread to think what other rooms would be like if this was an upgrade. Upon inspection of the room we found stale food in the fridge obviously left behind by previous occupants and bed sheet was crumbled with hair on it,  a/c remote was dirty with battery cover missing and remote not working, whilst a/c did work it made hell of a noise all night, it felt like I was still on plane with engine noise, toilet flush did work but water flow would still carry on wasting water until two handy men came and supposedly repair it I found that hitting the flush button a few time did the trick.  Breakfast room is so small it is congested in the morning with hardly any room to move, staff some were ok whilst others felt they were doing you a favour. when I complained about the room and left over food I was told come back tomorrow and we will find you a better room however when I went to the reception the next day I was told they do not have any spare rooms so there is nothing they could do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r629682149-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452389098,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,1200,5,16,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dhanji_1,Natu D,F4661E819301A29620A8E399637CF6C3,,186338,"London, United Kingdom",London,Dhanji_1,,,,,,,,"B.N.

Good location,3,2018-03,25-03-2018,The hotel is located very close to the airport and opposite the ville parle railway station. We opted for breakfast and dinner buffet. The spread was very thin but the food quality was very good. Tasty food. You can expect one chicken dish every night. But dont expect any leg piece in the dish. I wonder why.

I am sure you will find far better place in Mumbai at the same cost,3,2017-09,12-12-2017,"I have stayed here for over 12 times in the last 3 years. We have been using their conference rooms to conduct training programmes every single month for over 6 years now and yet they absolutely unprofessional. 

Earlier, they used to offer airport pick up and drop facility for free. Recently they have started charging for the same. Inspite of an email reminder of my pickup time from the airport, the cab hadn't come. I had to wait for 25 minutes at the airport for the cab to arrive.

The rooms in the new building are quite nice but the bathroom is not clean. The rooms in the old building is really horrible. And mind you, they both cost the same and they could dump you in any of the building based on their decision.

2. Good Breakfast. 
3. Good and supportive staff members

5. Big LCD TV, very good standalone window ACs.
6. Toilet and Room amenities are OK. 
7. Wi fi connectivity is good.

(-)
1. comparatively tiny rooms.
2. Bed is not comfortable- thinner mattress.
3. Wooden furniture and fixtures are old and need to be changed - the shine has lost.
4. the room floor has carpet - old style - unhygenic as the same is not cleaned by vacuum cleaner daily. 
5. Lobby level Coffee shop - where breakfast is given is too small to cater the in-house hotel guests.

Ideal location but best avoided if possible,2,2017-12,04-12-2017,"Real mixed feelings about this place, family have stayed before and came highly recommended. Ideally located in the city which is its best feature. 

I’ll avoid giving you war and peace so here’s a rundown of the reasons for the poor rating:

1. Complimentary Transfers - although the website says airport pickup and drop off is free as did one of my booking confirmations I was told policy had changed making it chargeable yet some of our family travelling with us on their own booking were able to use the complimentary service.. 

2. Noise - A/C seems to make a lot of noise even when switched off, sounded much like the ducts to an open service room as lots of echo’s of people at work. Secondly, hotel staff arrived for work very early, dropping things on the floor and talking across the hallway. All this equals uncomfortable nights sleep.. 

3. Reservation and Payment - during both of our stops here we were asked to settle the balance on check in rather than check out. Whilst this doesn’t bother us, the issue was how the staff manage expectations.  Whilst travelling and before we arrived for the second stay at the hotel I received several emails asking me to contact the hotel as there was a problem with my payment card. When I called I was told everything was fine... Interestingly I booked and settled both stays on the same debit card!

To summarise, not a devastating stay but evidence that guests are treated differently on an individual basis. There is clearly some favouritism towards regular visitors.

Location is the only thing going for this place,3,2017-10,19-11-2017,"Stayed 4 nights. We were upgraded to a suite in the main building where reception is but the room was very tired. You could not open the blinds without them coming down altogether so no natural light in the room. Bathroom was ok, Aircon was very loud. Tip - always carry earplugs.  Only room mirror was on the bathroom door and only 1 socket worked in the ‘suite’ making very hard to use curlers, own hairdryer etc even remotely close to the mirror. Checking in was looong, would not let us bring our bags in until after checking in! We found breakfast to be ok. The only thing going for this place is the location. Close to good restaurants, shops, railway station. However, if they don’t improve the couldn’t care less attitude and the standard of the rooms, most people I know would prefer to pay a little more and travel to where they need to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r542127410-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452386603,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,1200,4,10,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dotnjit,dotnjit,1A2C826F6B5F6907431BA60F887726EC,,,,,dotnjit,,Customer Relationship Manager,575077020,en,22-04-2018,HotelParleInt,"Dear sir,

Its Less than a budget hotel.,2,2017-07,13-09-2017,"i have went to Parle International for 2 days Corporate event. It was an embarrassing event both for the host and participants. It was in monsoon season of Mumbai, the hotel was having a stale smell and was not properly cleaned. Breakfast and Buffet served was an average. No proper parking facility available, its based on customer priority. One of the guest car was bashed, on road parking as Hotel doesn't allow a parking, instead of parking availability

Hotel staff is rude and unfriendly, non co-operative. They didn't care for their guest at all. None of their issue has been addressed. Manager had mentioned clearly, ""This is how we function.""

In all, 2 days corporate event was good, but we will never select or suggest Hotel Parle International as location. 

I think office based events would be much better than this..:P

Out of the 4 power points that I could find , only 2 worked for mobile charger , & 3 for laptop.
Light fixtures are not at par with the standard.
geyser stopped working everyday after night 10. (Dunno the issue with this , but this happened on all 3 days of my stay, it worked during the day, stopped during the night)

good stay,4,2016-01,12-01-2016,the staff were courteous and helpful. there was a prompt response to requests for supplies even at night. the rooms were cleaned regularly. the mattresses were too soft for my taste and gave me a backache. maybe the hotel should consider having a few hard mattresses available for those who prefer them. ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r339335005-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452361217,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,1200,1,4,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/928veenam,Veena M,AB22ABB29FAC2746FED7B224633D472E,,295424,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dubai,928veenam,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
It's a good value if you want to stay in South Mumbai but...,3,2016-01,10-01-2016,"....the hotel was lacking on a few dimensions.

First, and most importantly, the Hotels.com description and photos are slightly deceiving at best, dishonest at worst. The photos are all very nice, modern, and updated. Upon arrival, however, they showed us the options -- either a room that hasn't been updated or an updated room without an attached bath. We felt like we were duped to a certain degree. That said, the rooms themselves are clean, which we certainly appreciated. And the location is quite convenient if you want to be in South Mumbai.

In general, the service was nice enough, but we had issues along the way. On three occasions we ordered breakfast or tea / coffee and it never came. The management also arranged a car to drive us to the airport. Not only was the car 20 minutes late, it's because the front desk had told the driver the wrong time. Finally, when checking out the total of expenses were jotted haphazardly on a piece of paper. It took 40 minutes to sort out the final bill because they were trying to charge us for a taxi ride that we hadn't taken. These were all frustrating encounters with the management. That said, all of our interactions with the other staff -- guards, elevator operators, and cleaners -- were incredibly positive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r338883726-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452389492,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,1200,61,112,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/843michelem,Michele M,9D7FD50DEC6D9058CB96D4A7E04B6996,,60795,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",Philadelphia,843michelem,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
The good and the bad,3,2016-01,05-01-2016,"My first visit was a very good one. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. Staff were friendly and gave good service. I would have rated it higher if only they were consistent.
When i returned from my tour I called a day before. Spoke to reservation who said that a room would be vacated the next day at noon and they would call and confirm and I could come and sit in the lobby while it was cleaned. Never called. When I reached there with family I called again. They told me to roam around while they confirmed. Hello! I was with family had children luggage and in taxi. What did he mean roam around ?
I told him they had not called earlier and had even suggested i wait at the lobby. At that the person quite rudely answered There are no rooms. And cut the phone.
I would have wished to go there or recommend it to my friends but i am so put off by that silly attitude - its like we dont need you. We are doing you a favour by renting you a room.

Some of the cities best restaurants are located right next to us. The hotel provides a comfortable accommodation facility with its well furnished 50 rooms that caters to every individual's budget.""

I must mention here that indeed the hotel boasts of an excellent location, but every other claim is highly exaggerated. I was misled by some of the glowing reviews that this hotel has received on Trip Advisor, and I cannot fathom how they managed to do so. This is my experience.

I needed to stay close to a project site in downtown Mumbai and being taken in by the claims on the website and the reviews, I booked a room for 5 days at a price that I have got rooms at some of the best 5 Star properties in Mumbai earlier. The Superior Room that they offered me for a pricey Rs. 5250 was like my Engineering College Hostel Room with an added Air Conditioning! The Toilet was Humble to say the least and Awful at worst. Shockingly, the Superior Room did not even have a window. 

When I refused to accept that room, they upgraded me to a better room that was shown in the website photographs, but this was not provided with an attached bathroom, which was located across the corridor. Which as you can imagine is very inconvenient. 

The much touted Family Managed Hotel is just a smokescreen for poorly managed staff and unprofessional service. I used to work nights on my project and sleep during the day till noon, when I had the Do Not Disturb sign on. When I woke I put the Please Clean My Room sign, but nobody turned up to clean the room, despite my personal request to a passing Housekeeper. The next evening the room was cleaned after I called Reception and complained.

Finally, the hotel has no real kitchen and cannot serve anything more than a coffee and sandwiches. The Complimentary Breakfast was 1 omelette and 2 slices of toast, 1 banana and a cup of tea everyday! This is in comparison to the awesome multi cuisine buffet spreads as all other hotels I have stayed at. With a little investigation, I understood that the management allocates a measly Rs. 60 per day for breakfast, or about 1% of the room tariff - nowhere near the industry norm, and hence the humble offering was not surprising.

I have requested my Friend and Agent to please not offer this hotel to anyone in future, as there is no value for money for the high tariff they demand as the place is run like an old lodge, hiding behind a facade of a Heritage property. I think that the hotel room is worth no more than Rs. 1,500 per day. The tariff they demand is just unjustified.

Kindly make more detailed inquiries before agreeing to stay here at any higher tariff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r332825944-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452391352,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,1200,1,22,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hemanthsharma,Hemanthsharma,9BF0F4A79F835608091E5F7F52DC7675,,297628,"Bengaluru, India",Bengaluru,Hemanthsharma,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
Chateau Windsor makes you feel at home,5,2015-10,09-12-2015,"Stayed 3 nights there in October and after the initial unease at being a single woman traveler in Mumbai, I really began to love this place. The staff could not have been more accommodating; they brought my breakfast (included in rates) up to my PH terrace each morning with the daily Bollywood newspaper.

Brilliant Stay in a Hotel older than our Independence.,4,2015-12,07-12-2015,"Centrally located at a stone's throw from Marine Drive. Very good veg and non-veg restaurants nearby and the hotel connects you directly to those and allows you to enjoy good food from the comfort of your room. Gaylord Restaurant and Shiv Sagar ( the most famous pav-bhaji of Mumbai is available here ) restaurant are again at a stone's throw distance from this hotel. Very well-maintained premises. Colaba and all other lively places are walkable or 7-8 mins by cab from the hotel.

Staff were very polite, helpful, friendly and professional in their simple yet effective ""CWH"" attire. 

Hotel was worth the money as per Mumbai Standards where real estate is very expensive. Our room was quite large. Breakfast was very basic - 2 bread pieces toast, jam, omlette/potato culet, a banana and tea. However, good to get you started and tasty. I went to the kitchen was so very impressed by the cleanliness there. I wish I would have taken the snap. Basic tea/coffee and very tasty Mumbai Grilled Veg sandwiches are available from the in-hotel kitchen which is very good for quick bites. 

Overall, our stay was excellent in every way.

What helps the hotel is the ease with which a cab can be taken to places nearby for very short distances. The cab drivers in Mumbai were a revelation for the Bangalorean in me. They do not want to fleece you. Even if you leave your cell phone or bag with them, they will return it to you. You can travel safely at any time of the night with them. They rarely decline or ask for more money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r331170388-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1664,87284473,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/33/da/f9/nehathegr81.jpg,2496,22,74,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nehathegr81,Nehathegr81,DE85507C25E20C5C06B7D7BE071FAA74,,297628,"Bengaluru, India",Bengaluru,Nehathegr81,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
Outstanding service,5,2015-11,30-11-2015,"Stayed here for two nights in November 2015 and there were lots of great things about the Chateau Windsor: great service, AC, tasty Indian breakfast, perfect location between Marine Drive and Churchgate station, surrounded by nice restaurants with their menu available in the room, and satellite tv with some channels from home! (that’s luxury for us).  Yes it was more expensive than the rest of India, but everything is in Mumbai.  The best thing was the service.  The reception desk booked an overnight bus to Aurangabad for us, then after we had checked out there was a waiting room and bathroom for us to use before we left.  Finally, when it was time for us to leave, a man was sent down to get us a taxi and had a long conversation with the driver so as to be 100% certain we were dropped off in the right place.  For me, that’s outstanding service.  One last thing – taxi drivers may not understand the name of the hotel if you say it the French way!  Pronounce it Cha-tee-oh instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r330058816-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452391352,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,1200,22,36,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailsofthUnexpected,TrailsofthUnexpected,36E79DEB735FD86131A0311179E4A67E,,186338,"London, United Kingdom",London,TrailsofthUnexpected,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

However they turned off the A/ c so I was forced to decamp to the airport to wait 8 hours for my plane.Centrally  located, although beyong the architecture, the Gateway to India and the the Taj Mahal hotel where the terrorist attack happened I fail to see why one would stay in Mumbai except for business. I would not return considering the many other options available. I paid 650 rupees for my taxi from the set fee place at the airport ( I recommend this , especially for a first time visitor) and 500 rupees ( negotiated before getting in!) in an a/c less cab on the way back to the airport...I gave  a 50 rupee note as tip which was hugely appreciated.

There is a small supermarket on the corner next to the train station.  it is easy to get a taxi to anywhere, and you can be at VT easily in half an hour by taxi.  Walking is straightforward in Mumbai, unlike most of India, and sidewalks will take you all the way to India Gate and beyond if you feel like strolling.

"Good value for the area, safe / clean hotel, would stay again but we just had one issue",3,2015-02,16-06-2015,"I recently stayed at this hotel. I was worried how good it would be, as I was on a budget and wanting to stay in a well located area. This fitted the bill, so with the good reviews in hand I went for it. 

The hotel is situated in a good location, right next to Marine Drive, Pizza by the Bay (restaurant) and some small shops / chemists (nothing fancy). The hotel always has at least one or two doormen, which may be quite common for the area (I don't know), but it was a nice touch I thought and they were always friendly, helpful and welcoming. For example one time they helped lend me some cash for the taxi by going to reception, as taxi's in Bombay often don't accept large bills and a large bill could be 500 rupees.

To get to the rooms or reception, you can either take the steep-ish stairs, or take their old style lift, with a cage door and a guy who takes you up and down. Once again, another touch I liked.

Check in at reception were not too helpful. I wanted a double room, but they could only offer a twin. They said I could switch later, but in such a way that I knew it wasn't really going to happen, and it didn't, we had the twin with beds pushed together. Not a big problem at all, I'm just noting it.

The room was spacious, had a good aircon system and ceiling fan, satellite TV with some US programming along with the local stuff, the bathroom was quite small but had a large mirror inside and on the door.

I had no problems with any noise, the breakfast was served in the room and I can't complain about the food itself, it was OK. One time they did mess up and not give us any breakfast, we had to call back on a couple of occasions and it took 45 mins to an hour in the end. Which was a shame, as it was a waste of time.

The hotel said they wanted to replace our sink, as it had a crack in it. They said it would take a couple of hours, so we agreed they could come in for a couple of hours while we were out. We came back and our bathroom and hotel floor was like a building site. The work was not complete, there was like cement dust on the floor and workmans tools left. Our possessions and everything were all safe and OK, it is just we did not expect this. We checked with reception and after 15 mins or so of messing around we managed to get a temporary room for an hour, so we could freshen up before going out in the evening.

Therefore it was not a perfect stay, but I would quite happily stay here again, knowing that it is well located, cheap and I know the rooms are perfectly OK. I would say this is a good choice on a budget, but if you want absolutely no issues then look elsewhere.

By the way the WiFi was free for us to use, but there was an annoying system where by you have to get reception to issue coupons, and they only issue a few at a time. These coupons can only be used on one device. The Wifi was good, except it is a bit of a faff to sort out getting the voucher and applying the voucher.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r280738425-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,200,293660921,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/80/e8/f9/qwertyfly.jpg,200,27,56,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qwertyfly,qwertyfly,155C2B5BAE21AF37BAE4D8046F02A695,,186338,"London, United Kingdom",London,qwertyfly,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

Our room was big compared to other hotels i have stayed in Mumbai, few places in Mumbai where a family can share a single room having a double bed, a single bed, and a sofa cum bed. the only drawback i feel is the English breakfast, it is something which we Indians wouldn't like to have day in and day out, some variety like Dosas or Rotis would be appreciated.

Average hotel,3,2017-07,23-07-2017,"I trained for a client for 6 days at Parle International. While certain aspects are great, some others need to be improved.

The good: The service is good. There is a housekeeping and tech person in our hall at all times. Projectors/speakers are taken care of by the staff. The food has good variety and there is enough staff to take care of your needs. We had variety for breakfast and lunch and were well taken care of. The loos are clean and well maintained. Special requests were promptly fulfilled - I needed some bowls and spoons for an activity and hot water for my tea bag.

The Bad: They have no cappuccino, which I thought was quite tragic!!! Weak, sweet coffee is really not my thing but I had to make do with that through 8 hours of training a day. The banquet halls have a damp and smelly air to it, maybe due to monsoons, which feels better once the ACs are on. It's not classy, it's more massy. Also, wires are taped to the carpet from the plug point all the way to the projector, which I think is a hazard since people can trip and fall. The speakers can be of better quality. They put us in a hall in a different building on the last day of the program, which was quite inconvenient. The loos were on a different floor and we had to walk back to the hotel for our lunch. With pouring rains, it wasn't exactly fun and we wasted a lot of time going back and forth. 

The property in general needs to be spruced up - at least the banquets. You'll find seat covers of chairs torn and paint peeling at places. The tissue dispensers in loos are help together with double sided tapes. My client booked me into this place although I'd choose something definitely better for my own training programs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r504993239-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1280,132571239,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/e6/e0/67/rovingeyes.jpg,960,76,104,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rovingeyes,Rovingeyes,6BD0132137B69CA90EB0B9BF5FB6159A,,,,,Rovingeyes,,,,,,,,"B.N.

Average stay,2,2017-07,23-07-2017,"The rooms here are disappointing. We booked a deluxe room. We were checked into an apartment room, which is slightly better than the deluxe room. 
Elevator was not clean and was smelly. To top it, the air-conditioner in the room did not work. 
The deluxe rooms are a big no. You have to pass through a dimly lit corridor to reach the rooms. There is also a bar on the way and it stinks of alcohol. The rooms were also stale. 
The complimentary breakfast was ok.

A hidden jewel in the Bustling city,4,2017-05,21-05-2017,"Stayed in this hotel for 4 days during a study trip in May. 
Surprised to find the hotel a good value for the money paid.   Executive room was  good and everything was in working condition.  10 out of 10 for the quietness of the floors. 
Staff is good.   Mr.  Ali,  Mr.  Amjad and the young guy in the reception were all cooperative.

Irresponsible and rude staff,1,2017-05,17-05-2017,"I used to book frequently in this hotel (sort of blindly trusted them). Turns out that these people are the same. 

I was charged for Room Service which I never ordered in the first place. On raising a complain about the same, everyone from the servers to the reception staff to the accountants back tracked. They insisted that I had ordered room service and that the bill had my signature. (It's not possible that I would lie about what I ate for lunch unless I am stoned out of my mind!! :P ) Not someone to take things lying down, I chased them. I had hoped that they would at least agree to the fact that they had made a mistake and that their management had made me pay someone else's bill. But no to avail. 

All the staff practically ganged up and bullied me into agreeing that I had ordered room service. Relentlessly. The receptionist Rohit said, ""Oh please ask your parents if they ordered or not."" Like if they ate something, they wouldn't tell me? Bhai, rishte itne bhi kharab nahi hai humare. 

Nor am I that much of a looser to lie for a free meal. Trust me I have better ways of doing that.

Avoid at all costs. Terrible people! 

Needless to say, you have lost a long time costumer just because of some goddamn 'Paneer Butter Masala, two tandoori roti and one ice cream'. Hope you don't repeat the same with other people. 

PS : During our stay, the Hotel's owner had walked upto us and asked us how about the hotel. At that time, I had said that it's okay, the hotel is nice. I really take back my words now. It's really not about the money. It's about the ethics. And it's the basis of any hospitality industry.

They dont give good rooms initially until you complain about it,2,2017-04,22-04-2017,"I visited this hotel during my recent mumbai trip.

Front Desk officer (Name: Vijayan) was carrying some strange attitude. When you check in to the hotel you expect the hotel staff to greet you well.  Unfortunately they failed!

when I was allotted the room, it was stinking, the AC was making terrible noise and the telephone in the room was not working. The bathroom had ages old salutatory fittings. I felt cheated. I called up the hotel through my mobile (As telephone in my room wasn't functional) when I explained the issues the person said: ""Sir your's is Deluxe room, and our Deluxe rooms are like that only!"" After arguing too much over the phone, he sent a technician for namesake who came and saw the AC and went back! 

I went downstairs, and asked for room change immediately, after resisting a little they offered me another room which was slightly better. AC was still making noise.
I had to turn off the AC and had to sleep under the fan in hot sultry Mumbai weather.It was a nightmare for me.

While we are situated right in the heart of Mumbai's local market which can be tracked on Google Maps however we will take it up with the Uber App team on mapping our hotel on their map so guests don't face any transport issues from here on.

4This is a standard business hotel, value for money. The location is a but inside from the main road and crowded as it is the station road. But if you plan to use Mumbai suburb trains then it is a great location. The hotel is inside a market area. But you won't feel it as it is a separate entry altogether. The hotel us pretty big property. Has good reception area and other services like travel desk. Tbe reception services are good and warm. There is a restaurant and bar which I have not tried. You have many food options just outside. I was given a pretty big room in the new annexe building just adjacent to the main htel. But this is integral part of the hotel in terms of all te amenities and design. The buffet breakfast is good. Looks like professional. You get quite good choice including various Indian options, bread, eggs etc. They serve hot breakfast which you will like. Other services are good too. The airport to and fro is there but you have to check their timing. It was my third stay here. I first stayed in 2010 May.

Average hotel. Didn't feel very safe,2,2017-01,31-01-2017,"We stayed at Parle International for a week in January 2016.
This is a very average hotel in a very crowded part of Vile Parle East, not too far from the Domestic airport and a little distance from the International airport. The area around the gate to the hotel is quite dirty.
They offer free airport pickup/drop off and free wifi and our rate included breakfast. A kettle with tea/coffee, hair dryer and a safe are available in the room. An iron/iron board provided on request. 
Rooms are quite modern except for the horrid, cheap floral curtains.  The rooms are clean and housekeeping was very responsive & prompt with any requests. Special mention to our housekeeper Moin who was extremely polite & efficient. 
The hotel has 2 buildings. We were in the Annax, across the driveway from the main building which houses the reception , bar and restaurant. Though this was preferable as it was quieter, as a woman I didn't feel very safe walking through the Annex as there was no security around. There is security at the gate, around the driveway and at the entrance of the main building, but none inside the Annex. One evening, coming back after dinner, there was a large group of very drunk men in the Annex. Another evening whilst coming back, there was a huge, noisy, fists-flying, fight going on in the main building which spilled out onto the driveway.
The wifi has a strong signal and is pretty quick except every couple of hours, you need to log back in as it cuts out. You also have to log back on every time you leave the room which can get annoying when you are staying for a week.
Room key cards was another annoying factor of our stay. As a couple, anywhere we stay, as a couple we've been given 2 key cards. Here we were given 2 key cards but only 1 worked at any given time. The moment 1 key card worked, the other stopped working. Weird!
All in all, this seems like a hotel used by domestic businessmen who need a place to shower and sleep.

"Key card system, maintenance of in-room facilities sucks big time! ",3,2017-01,30-01-2017,"This is a very basic hotel for those who expect just a room, shower and breakfast. 
Their key card doesn't work most times and you need to keep visiting the reception to fix it. We did this several times over just a 3 night stay and we have 2 nights more to go. Maintenance support for in-room facilities such as safes, Cable TV and remote, supply of tea/coffee sachets etc isn't programmed. You need to keep calling housekeeping or maintenance for replenishments or fixing things. Wifi codes expire in 24 hours even if you are staying longer. So you need to keep calling for fresh codes. 
Guest service staff have rudimentary skills and can do better. 
The only saving grace was Vilas, the night bellman who had the grace to offer me a cup of ginger tea at 5 am. 
I had arrived at 4 am on 27th Jan morning and my check in time was after 12 noon.

Most pathetic service ever,1,2016-12,13-12-2016,"Was supposed to check in today; i received a call yesterday to reconfirm the booking and was even asked the expected time of arrival. I informed them that I will be arriving around 9 am to which they said yes, its ok no problem. When i reached the hotel the front desk denied a room and said check in time in 12. When we told them that we received a call from the hotel yesterday and they said its ok to come at 9; the person at the reception got very rude and said ""read your booking confirmation and read what it says in black and white. It says check in time is 12 pm"". We told them that this was a very very rude remark and asked for the manager and he said I myself am the manager (when he obviously was not). When we again asked him why did you not tell us we cannot check in at 9 when you asked us on the phone what time we are arriving and when we said 9 am, why did you say its ok. He said i don't know, i will give you a room at 12, not before that and if you want you can leave.

Très bonne adresse,5,2014-05,25-04-2015,"Hôtel parfait par sa position et son prix. Après avoir fait le tour des hôtels du sud de mumbai, il s'est avéré que c'était le moins cher. Aucun autre hôtel ne nous proposait une chambre pour quatre. Le cadre n'est pas luxueux mais simplement très correct. Le staff est très serviable et efficace, le petit déjeuner très bien et la terrasse pour le repas très appréciable. Il y a de plus une boulangerie en face qui propose des baguettes ;) 
L'hôtel est situé entre la gare de churchgate et marine lines (quoi demander de mieux ?). La vue le soir est magnifique, la gare à une minute, un excellent glacier la rue derrière, une supérette et la poste au bout. 
Je recommande fortement cet hôtel à tous les voyageurs en famille, entre amis ou même ceux qui viennent pour le travail.

Beautiful room,4,2015-02,15-04-2015,"The Chateau Windsor is a lovely three-storey hotel with a friendly and welcoming staff. It is located in an extremely central location in the center of South Mumbai, close to many restaurants, historic sites, and the ocean-front promenade. It is an ideal place to be based for any stay in Mumbai.

Our room was spacious, had a comfortable bedding and included a private bathroom in the corridor and a balcony. Some bedrooms don’t have any windows, but ours had two large ones that brought us the sunlight but also the noise from the busy boulevard which fortunately becomes more quiet at night! In the morning, Chateau Windsor serves a delicious and extensive breakfast in the rooms until 11am and sometimes later.

One inconvenience is the bathrooms are across the hall which are unlocked with a key, so you have to take two large keys with you. One to unlock the bathroom, one to unlock your room.

Otherwise, safe was broken (requested a fix, they came took a look with no follow-up), AC was missing remote control (they brought a new remote), cover blanket was unwashed with traces of hair so requested a new clean sheet (they said OK, but never sent one), and reception didn't have a map.

Good place for its money in the very heart of Mumbai,5,2015-01,24-03-2015,"Its a really good place for average tourists as prices are too high in Mumbai. Very rarely you can find triple rooms in good hotels in Mumbai - so you have to take 2 rooms. For budget tourists its too costly. Here you will get a good triple room for best cost. Better ask for triple room with extra bed not sofa as it is more comfortable. All day rounf hot water is available. Breakfasts are included in the room cost and you can take as per your choice continental breakfast or Indian breakfast (which contains more solid food like veg cutlets, banana, tea/coffee with jam and butter toast and omlette). Breakfast can be delivered either to your room or you can take it on the terrace located on the roof of the building with nice view. You can leave your bags in lock room just for 100Rs after check-out and it is really safe there. Staff is polite, helpful but a bit slow as almost everywhere in India. I recommend this hotel. Its very close to Churchgate station, food shop Syrodya near station, Marine Drive, Main attractions like Bombay University (within walkable distance), Colaba and Gateway of India are easily reachable by cab (tell it should be by meter - dont agree for costly price) - it will take max 5 min.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r261490476-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,480,113509639,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/c4/05/07/avatar.jpg,480,150,182,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sweet_lana1710,Sweet_lana1710,091B2CDA2FA24E08ACC1CF7DAB3CAB96,,2378667,"Essentuki, Russia",Essentuki,Sweet_lana1710,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
"Good value for money in South Mumbai, Ideal location!",4,2014-10,23-03-2015,"It was my second stay in the Chateau Windsor in Churchgate, and I definitely recommend this accommodation as it is one of the best value for money in South Mumbai: it is hard to find a good and clean place with decent rates there. The staff is also very courteous and helpful.

Of course, the first impression can be a little surprising, the building organisation is very peculiar (reception desk looking like out of a 50s' movie and located in the top floor) but be patient and you will not be disappointed. Rooms are clean and large. Bathrooms are smaller and can smell of mothballs but they are clean so this won't be an issue. If you are three people, you can easily be accommodated in one room without feeling cramped. Depending on the room, you will have no view (darker but quieter rooms) or a view on the front street (more light but more noise as well). 

Regarding the breakfast, you can ask for it to be delivered to your room (they are also very flexible with early morning breakfast in case you have a flight/train to catch) or you can eat it on the rooftop. Breakfast is simple (nothing like a 5* hotel buffet) but you will have eaten well and enough to start your visits. The rooftop is not well done, it is an empty space with plastic chairs and tables, where you can take some sun and admire the view on the nearby stadium and on the street below.

The location is without doubt the main advantage of this hotel. It is in Churchgate, very close to Marine Drive, and Kala Ghoda. You can easily take a taxi and reach all the major touristic attractions of South Mumbai. If you love to walk, you can even do most of the things by walk itself (Victoria Station, Gateway of India, ...).

My advice: get past your first impression and you will enjoy your stay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r261210965-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1024,108170622,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/72/8d/7e/isabellek69.jpg,1024,49,268,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isa_bigh,isa_bigh,8076649C19973EADDCCCE9FE135D35F2,,187337,"Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt,isa_bigh,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

Great locality,5,2015-01,09-03-2015,"My wife and I have made Chateau Windsor our home away from home when in Mumbai. Stayed there on Jan 19 - 21, 2015 and again on our return on Feb 12 and 13th, 2015 before returning to South Africa. Very conveniently located near all amenities and great eatries all round. My wife never ever missed her ice-cream evry night directly opp the Hotel. Staff are ver obliging and the service prompt and dignified.

"Poor service, pathetic experience",1,2016-10,11-10-2016,"We stayed in this hotel for one night last week and it was indeed a nightmare. Here's the summary of my experience:

1. The room which was allotted to us was under maintenance. In fact the entire building was being repaired, full with dust and smell of paints. 
2. They gave us another room which was again not anything great. It has though two separate beds. We called reception to change the room but they responded very unprofessionally saying that there is no other room available and we accept the allotted room with whatever condition it was in.
3. Since midnight the toilet flush stopped working. Till morning no one cared to bring it to a working condition. With our multiple follow-ups with house keeping and front desk a guy came only to inform us that someone closed the water connection due to maintenance work. It was really frustrating to know that it took them entire night and several hours in the morning only to figure out that the water supply was closed. They said it might take another one hour to restore the water supply. The room was changed later on when we escalated the issue.
3. The responses we got from house keeping and front desk staff was very discouraging and unprofessional. 
4. Food is over priced and less in quantity. Taste is average.
5. Complimentary breakfast was decent.

The hotel has got comparatively larger rooms (at least the ones we saw) and that's probably the only thing I liked about this hotel.

I had been to other neighboring hotels and find them much better than this one. Overall a very bad experience with extremely bad service and poor complaint management. Would never recommend to anyone and/or like to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r427010195-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,50,111299016,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/a2/49/c8/shabbeer-z.jpg,50,0,2,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shabbeerz,Shabbeer Z,5D8183CE2B8B4EE7213603A4C65D4FFE,,297654,"Pune, India",Pune,shabbeerz,,Front Office Manager,427490232,en,12-10-2016,Sunvan11,"Dear Sir,

"Amazing visit, amazing stay.",5,2016-09,12-09-2016,"Wonderful rooms. The staff is incredibly polite and well trained. They have their own parking space. And the breakfast was simply spectacular.
Couldn't find a single point to complain about except perhaps lack of a continental breakfast, but then again I would be nitpicking and searching for a flaw.
The complimentary airport drop is a huge bonus, really added lustre to our trip.
If it seems like I am showering nothing but praises, trust me I'm a harsh critic. But this place truly deserves the rating and review.
Special mention: the restaurant in the hotel called Nimantran serves excellent Gujarati thali.

Pathetic service. Non empathetic staff,1,2022-09,15-09-2022,"I am staying in Kohinoor continental. I had a confirmed reservation for past 15 days with this hotel. I specifically called in the morning today and requested manager Azad to block a quiet room for me coz m a single lady traveller and I have a very hectic schedule. So I need a peaceful sleep in the night. I called twice to request the same. During check in I again requested them for a quiet room he said yes I am giving u a quiet room. He has given me a road facing room which is highly noisy and there is disturbance of constant trucks outside. I called front desk and spoke to dhawal requesting him to change my room as it's noisy. He directly refused that it's not my mistake n I can't do anything. I cannot change ur room and u cannot even check out because u have a non refundable booking. He says that hotel is sold out and my senior has made a mistake so can't do anything. He said if u wish to call Mr. Manohar out owner, u r free to call. 

Staff is not at all empathetic. Inspire of requesting 3 times to provide quieter room I was allocated noisy room. Dey are not at all sensitive towards single lady traveller. Staff is highly unprofessional and say v cannot do anything because of our colleagues mistake.

Terrible Setvice,1,2022-06,08-06-2022,"I visited the cafe/restataunt today. As it was past 1100 hrs. They advise me that I could only order burger and French fries as they are busy with the lunch buffet. I order for burger which would come with French fries and a black coffee to Mr Rutikesh. I told him since burgers come with French fries so I don't want French fries. After waiting for over 15 minutes one Mr Tyren comes with French fries telling me the burger will come shortly. Thinking that they give burgers and French fries separately at this restraunt, I have my French fries. Once I finish that I ask for my burger but it's still not ready. After waiting 30 minutes I call the incharge and he says it will come in another 5 minutes. Then my burger arrives after another 10 minutes with French fries again. Now I realise these guys have tricked me by taking a burger order and then quietly giving me French fries first. Rightly they have billed me for the burger and French fries separately. To make matters worse, when I ask for my coffee, they have forgotten my order of the coffee. I reorder for it and wait for another 5 minutes for it.  The staff seems least interested which shows in their way of taking orders and forgetting orders. Also 30 to 40 minutes for a chicken burger is an all time record in my books.

Good hotel with worst services,2,2016-07,04-08-2016,I stayed in this hotel during my business trip to mumbai. As this is adjacent to Vile parle station and near to domestic airport so i choose this hotel. As the location of the hotel is just near to Vile parle station  so area is crowded. Rooms were clean and nicely maintained though i missed the charging point near bed. Sleep quality was good. Breakfast was ok but services were pathetic. I could not understand why all staff was busy with nothing. They all tends to stand between buffet table and kitchen way so no one can call them. Drinking water i got after finishing of my breakfast that too after lots of reminders. Tea i finally succeeded in getting after so much wait and reminders.

Third stay in Parle International,5,2016-05,15-05-2016,"Despite being inside a marketing complex, this hotel exudes a semblance of class and a bit of old Mumbai hotel charm.

It's a stone's throw away from the Ville Parle station, and about a kilometer from the Western Expressway - 15 mins from the airport.
The beds are excellent, the staff well-trained and courteous, the rooms are quite large and spacious, the bed quality is excellent. Minus a pool, it's pretty much 3-star.

Excellent,5,2015-01,11-02-2015,"This is a budget hotel, but the rooms are comfortable and in good decorative order. Breakfast is simple but tasty. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of many tourist attractions. The thing that really makes this hotel outstanding though is the service. We were greeted with a smile and check-in was fast and efficient. Room service and housekeeping were also great. My boyfriend was ill while we were staying here and they called a doctor for us who arrived promptly and whose charges were reasonable. When I then asked where I could find a pharmacy to get his prescription filled, the receptionist offered to send one of the porters to go for me, which is thought was a great touch. The door staff were always willing to help with hailing a taxi or giving directions. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers who don't want to pay a fortune for a hotel in Mumbai.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r253643144-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452389216,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,1200,36,112,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aimee_Boyle,Aimee_Boyle,501AF9067D74ADE72215F1616F241799,,188630,"Leiden, The Netherlands",Leiden,Aimee_Boyle,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

Had a quite good stay here,4,2015-01,01-02-2015,"Many reasons why one should stay here if Marine Drive or Nariman point is the area.
Located next to Hotel Ambassador and opposite to ""Pizza by the bay"" and half a km from Flora fountain. Hardly 20 steps from Marine drive so enjoyed leisure walking in Marine Drive till late 2 o'clock in the night.
Rooms are very spacious. Staff is ever helping and greeting with smile. Great value for money especially at such a good location. 
We reached one hour before the check in time (12 in the noon)...as rooms were not ready, we were given a small but good room to stay for an hour. It was quite courteous on their part.
Deluxe rooms are rejuvenated one and hence better than Superior rooms at INR 600-700 extra but only difference is in interiors and nothing else. Having said that please remember that you won't have any problem in superior rooms also and they are quite good.
Limited hot water timing is an issue...please ask management while checking in.
Wi-fi doesn't work everywhere at least didn't work in my room. Service was simply great.
Ask for quiet rooms as it's very near to Marine drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r252167584-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1600,101734735,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/10/59/4f/ashish619.jpg,1200,82,53,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashish619,ashish619,FF621DC3149E82C3ADD33802C4B44738,,297628,"Bengaluru, India",Bengaluru,ashish619,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

Good place,4,2014-12,16-01-2015,"We stayed 2 nights at the Windsor in Deluxe Room accommodation. The rooms were clean and spacious, the bathroom as well. The bed is really soft and comfortable. Staff are friendly and accommodating.

The hotel is a few km walk to the main Colaba sights, but metered taxis are cheap so not too far to get to the taj hotel or gateway and will only cost you around 50rupees.

Breakfast is served on the roof top overlooking the cricket stadium, you can watch the crows trying to steal left overs which is fairly entertaining.

Wifi is free but they give you this 30 digit pass code that you have to enter every time you connect which is annoying. The TV has cable and lots of free movie channels which is good if you want to relax in the room.

Excellent choice for our budget,4,2014-12,12-01-2015,"This was a great hotel for our first stay in Mumbai. At first we were unsure because of the old elevator and lobby on the 5th floor but our room was very nice for the cost. We reserved the double and single bed room and they were even able to fit another rollaway in our room when a fourth person was added to the booking last minute (for a price). Our room had a balcony that overlooked Veer Nariman Rd, it was very nice but also loud, honking until 1 am...but that might be anywhere you stay in Mumbai haha. The breakfast on the rooftop was very beautiful as we were there early most mornings and watching the sun rise over the city was very nice. The food itself was nothing special, although my husband loved the potato pancakes they served (I can't remember what they called them but they were just like latkes). We could also order bottled water and beer to our room at all hours and that was very convenient as well. There was free wifi but the code changed every day and you could only use it on one device per person. 

The hotel is very close to Marine Drive, so that provided nice sunset viewings and walks along the Queen's Necklace at night. We also were able to walk to Gateway of India, Prince of Wales Museum and Colaba Markets from there (warning: we are walkers so it was probably a good 20 min walk).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r249059788-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,640,101620595,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/0e/9b/73/gina-g.jpg,640,1,33,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodonmyplate,Gina G,6AF2325B295F963C9C6FCFC923B68D17,,32655,"Los Angeles, California",Los Angeles,foodonmyplate,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
Fantastic Hotel,5,2015-01,09-01-2015,"Probably the best value for money hotel in the Mumbai (Churchgate, Fort, Colaba area) if you a reading these reviews to find the best bang for your buck look no further you have just found it. 
We are an Australian family travelling around India for 3 weeks with our kids age 10&13. We arrived at the hotel hours before check in but this was no problem at all, check in was super efficient and we were quickly shown to our family room with queen bed, single and bed settee, spotlessly clean ensuite, massive TV with satellite and balcony overlooking Veer Nariman and Marine Drive, just perfect. Mumbai hotel prices are significantly higher than most Indian cities as you will aware of if you are checking them out and with this in mind we were a little concerned that Chateau Windsor may not deliver but it was excellent. There are staff everywhere, all smiling and chatting and really eager to assist with luggage, sightseeing suggestions, taxis etc.
Breakfast though basic (included in room rate) was hot and delicious with the option of room service or alfresco dining on the roof terrace, which we chose to do. There is no dinner menu though meals can be ordered in and the hotel is surrounded by high quality restaurants, there are lower budget Indian restaurants and some fantastic mid and high range options, we ate at Saltwater and Gaylords which both worked out approx $50 for family of 4 which is expensive for India but in the real world superb value. 
I would highly recomend this hotel, the service and clenliness are excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r248452725-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452390504,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,1200,207,600,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msga12,msga12,26FE25B143CE7045F5CC072684A06265,,,,,msga12,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

"Basic homely hotel, great location",3,2014-12,07-01-2015,"We stayed as a family of four here for one night. The hotel facilities are rather basic, more like that of a budget hotel, though clean and with hospitable staff. 

We were given one family room with three beds for the price of a double room, and another double room. The family room on the 5th floor was rather noisy as it was next to the kitchen which got busy early in the morning. However, it also meant that we could dip in to request for extra cups or spoons from an obliging kitchen staff! No complaints, except that the hotel somehow felt rather like a government guest house in a remote location in decor and ambience. Basic furniture, no toiletries in the bathroom, no kettle or coffee maker, and no top sheets on the beds to cover yourself or to line the blankets. 

Breakfast on the terrace too was a very basic affair - egg, toast, banana and coffee, which one had to wait for 20 minutes to be got ready and brought. The roof top could be made more colourful with more flowering plant pots and greenery or cane chairs, but the management seem to have decided to keep everything at the most basic, functional level. Certainly everything functions adequately. So whatever we requested was promptly done, the big garden umbrellas in the roof top restaurant did help to keep the glaring sun out, and the breakfast was quite edible and the coffee hot and plentiful. Not a luxurious or memorable stay, but comforable enough in a homely sort of way.

Of the several pluses is the courteous Mr Raja who arranged on the usual taxi rates his own car and driver for us to go out of Bombay on an excursion, and the cheerful and non obstrusive staff.  But the best part is the access to the beautiful Marine Drive at night, which keeps busy with walkers, hawkers, couples and families till the small hours of the morning, and where we walked around till after mid night. We were grateful to have a reasonably comfortable hotel to come back to, safely, and so closeby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r248038700-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452387345,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,1200,35,53,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeenaR173,Meena R,FD6AC2EE691E1EE82385A46340AE4234,,304551,"New Delhi, India",New Delhi,MeenaR173,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
Average hotel,3,2014-12,05-01-2015,"The hotel is housed in a building that includes other businesses as well. The reception is located on the fifth floor, while the rooms are on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors. We were given a room on the 2nd floor and every time we left the hotel, someone would have to go up to the 5th floor first to drop off the room keys, and then go down again. It was quite inconvenient!

Breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace. It is a very basic affair of toast, omelet, banana and tea/coffee. The terrace is also devoid of any decor and the tables are simple wooden ones, with plastic chairs.

The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were very clean.

The location of the hotel is excellent, right next to the Ambassador hotel, and a stone's throw from Marine Drive. There are numerous eating outlets nearby. Churchgate station is also very close by.

"Looks like 3 stars, works like 1 star",1,2020-11,29-11-2020,"Kindly avoid at all cost!

I have never had such a horrid experience before, even after travelling all over the world. Very unfriendly, unhelpful staff, unclean rooms and to top it all, there was a blast in the room middle of the night because of some bell set-up cracking. Whole room was smelling like a furnace thereafter, and we had to go down twice to get electricians and keys for another room (because no staff was available to come up) and there was utter disregard for our safety as well of fellow customers in the hotel, as the staff took the incident very lightly and asked us to go back to the same room and wait for electricians, instead of asking us to wait in the lobby, while examining the seriousness of the issue, which any decent hotel would have. The next room given to us was equally bad, bed was small, dirt below the bed, smelly, stained shower curtains and so on. We also paid for all meals, which was again, tribble, and tea/coffee was additionally chargeable in breakfast (that’s new!) and so were the toiletries like tooth brush/dental kit etc.

Barely Makes it to the mark,3,2020-02,02-03-2020,"Having stayed in the hotel for multiple occassions for my business trips I can very well list the pore n cons of the property.
Pros
1. Decently sized rooms.
2. Housekeeping is quite decent
3. The Beds are comfortable.

Cons.
1. The breakfast spread lacks in variety and is often tight in options and efficiency
2. The pool they have is for pool parties and has a fountain in it so no swimming.
3. The television barely has a channel that's not free to air and you need some decent channels it takes quite a lot of pestering.
4. The restaurant and room service staff are very slow.
5. Menu is overpriced compared to taste.
6. No views either the rooms open up to the Mumbai Metro platform or to a residential complex.
7. The tower B has an idiotic control box for the lights with half the buttons need to be jumped upon to turn off the lights.

All in all not worth if you are spending from your own pockets.

My Stay @ Parle International,3,2016-04,26-04-2016,"I was looking for a hotel near Mumbai International airport. Going by the looks of the photos available in the website (Makemytrip), Hotel Parle International gave an impression of being a 3+ Star hotel. Location is prime, near Vila parle railway station.
Appearances are often deceptive and that's what exactly I could say about this hotel. It was evident that it is an age old hotel and has recently underwent some form of renovation and hence the catchy pictures in website. Rooms were pretty decent

The quality of room, cleanliness and professionalism was at its best. Some hiccups here and there but csn be ignored since nothing is perfect. I will stay again at this place whenever in Mumbai.

Although I do want to metion one small thing that for eating they have 1 main restaurant where they had some festival so  a la carte option was not available. However sometimes In house just want to relax and go out of the room. Plus the food rates for in room dinning was very expensive.

Would not go again,2,2019-10,31-10-2019,"I picked this hotel for a few nights stay while travelling back from Jaipur to home on the back of previous reviews. All I can say is I don’t know where they were staying. The room was not good with dirty marks over the walls, pealing wall paper, noisy air conditioning although the shower was very good. 
The food here was repetitive and for some reason it was always cold. I think they put it cold in the serving heaters and rely on this to heat it through. The meat dishes were in my view awful and was full of bones which put me off straight away. The plates were often dirty and I had to go through the rack to pick a clean plate. 
The hotel itself was clean and the lobby area was well presented along with the corridors. I do think this hotel needs a make over to bring it up to a higher standard. 
It is down as a hotel near the airport but this is wrong it is a good 20 to 30 minute ride through the busy streets.

Again the airport pick up was complimentary and the driver was there at the airport with a pluck card flashing my name on it so did not had to wait. Location is superb Airport as well as Railway station is very close by.

A VFM hotel opposite to Railway station east side,4,2016-02,28-02-2016,I had booked this hotel for a single night for me and my wife for Rs 1700 a night .The hotel was bang opposite Vile Parle Station on the East side and which is really a big factor in Mumbai .Also it is very close to the airport which was also a very big consideration for me .The hotel is clean and the service efficient .The breakfast included in the package was  a mixture of south indian dishes and omlet etc which was good enough for us .The only small hitch was the water flow in toilet which was corrected to an extent by the housekeeping staff quickly but would say the only small glitch which we faced during our stay .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r351557272-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452390416,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,1200,12,36,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DilipA,Dilip H,1FD3D58C089CA95CE51FC8636EE6B668,,,,,DilipA,,Front Office Manager,359210952,en,27-03-2016,Sunvan11,"Greeting from Hotel Parle International!!

Disgusting and Inhumane,1,2016-01,27-02-2016,"Our family of 4 returned to Mumbai from our pilgrimage to Nasik and Shirdi on the 31st January about 5.30 pm tired, hungry but spiritually fulfilled. We were checked-in by a tall man wearing glasses who was impolite, mechanical and lacked social skills. Without making eye contact, he speedily completed the check-in and asked the porter to take our luggage to a building across the road to the adjoining street. When we asked why we had to move to an outbuilding he abruptly answered that the hotel has another wing. So we all picked up parts of our own luggage to take across as the porter did not even have a trolley to wheel our luggage across. The outbuilding looked old and delapidated. The lift was small and awkward. When we got to our rooms, we were greeted by a dirty room service tray that had not been cleared. The porter managed to open the room doors and abruptly asked which bags should be placed in which rooms. Once that was done, he looked at us expectantly for a tip for something that we had done ourselves - that is carry our own bags. We just thanked him and ignored his expectant look for a tip so he left feeling despondent. I buzzed reception requesting them to remove the dirty tray from the entrance to my room. We then went into the washrooms to take a wash and prepare for dinner and noticed that there were no hand towels. Again I buzzed reception and another front desk staff told me to ring housekeeping to arrange this myself. By this time I was annoyed as I had to arrange my check-in all by myself. Are guests expected to check that everything is in order prior to checking in? My family and I washed up and went all the way back to the main reception. By this time, my 73 year old mom was getting agitated that we had to walk back and forth several times even to get a proper meal in this place. Our booking was 2 Executive Rooms with breakfast and wi-fi and we had booked this via agoda. We were naturally expecting much better. The cost of the Executive Room at the hotel is Rs9500-Rs10500 but what we got was not worth even Rs2000. I finally gave the front office my voucher which he had refused to collect when I offered it to him during our check-in. We insisted that we were unhappy with the dog-kennel-like rooms he had put us in the outbuilding and that he is to give us rooms to the value we have paid. Another short man with glasses at the front desk intercepted and spoke abruptly, rudely and arrogantly and by this time we had had enough. We told them that we are going for dinner and that when we return, we are expecting to be moved to better rooms within the main building. Again the porter looked at us expectantly for a tip when we had to assist him to move our own luggage, but he got nothing as before. Wi-Fi in the main building was not working either and we had difficulty doing our online check-ins for our morning flights. We requested a scale to weigh our bags and that was not sent to our rooms. Breakfast in the morning was in a small room with not much room to move and not much variety to choose from. We just ate tea and toast and headed for the airport. The driver that dropped us off waited expectantly for a tip and got angry when he got nothing. We walked away wondering if the staff at hotel parle international were there to provide a service to their guests or merely there to collect cash handouts from tourists. Their staff are inhumane and the service is disgusting to say the least.

Hotel at Convenient Location but with Poor Maintenance,3,2016-02,17-02-2016,"Recently I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The location is great - in front of Vile Parle Railway Station in East. Next to this hotel is Dinanath Mangeshkar Natyagriha and a market. I was allotted a room in the annexe building. The room was spacious; however there were number of small cockroaches roaming in the room. The bellboy tried to kill couple of cockroaches with the TV remote when I entered the room for the first time. There is lack of round the clock security at the entrance of annexe building. The rooms have become older with visible signs of poor maintenance. The room has noisy window air conditioner. Though located in Mumbai, not many regional channels subscribed for the dish TV.
The elevator of the annexe building was not working for couple of days during my stay.
The food was good and tasty. The breakfast menu has good variety; however the area is too cramped. I had to request the other guests to allow me to share their table.

Terrible experience,1,2015-12,26-12-2015,"It all started when we reached the hotel. The staff was helpful in carrying the luggage to the reception. But, we were made to wait there for half an hour even though we had an online booking .Then they led us to a room .To my surprise the room hadn't been cleaned. It was stinking of alcohol and cigarettes . There were bottles lying around .They took another 30 minutes or so to provide us a different room. It was also stinking of cigarettes. It took them 3 calls to respond and we had to wait an hour outside the room.It even gets worse, the Air Conditioner was very noisy. The water wasn't warm enough. When i complained about the water ,  the person who came claimed that the water was hot and went away even though it was not. I had to call the service again . Luckily the second time, they provided us with buckets of  lukewarm water. I wouldn't recommend this hotel . Initially i was offered Room number 102 and after complaining they provided Room no 114",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r335149462-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452389422,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,1200,4,5,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nisargoo7,nisargoo7,180176BBACF19C573E786155212B47FB,,297608,"Ahmedabad, India",Ahmedabad,nisargoo7,,Front Office Manager,359242285,en,28-03-2016,Sunvan11,"Dear Sir,

Recommended on all fronts,5,2014-11,18-11-2014,"It is difficult to settle on a hotel in Mumbai. OK if you are willing to pay top dollar there are plenty of high end corporate options. For a mid price option we could not fault this hotel. Yes its a little quirky, access is by an old fashioned lift, a novelty in itself, made even more charming by the ever smiling front of house staff who are very helpful in arranging taxis at good value, at the drop of a hat. .It's a 40 minute taxi ride from the Airport which is typical for any where in South Mumbai. We stayed for 4 nights in room 429, super deluxe, it was spacious, immaculately clean, with a very comfortable bed,(one of the best we have slept in in India) clean linen and a bathroom with a good shower and it had a small balcony, ideal for watching the street life below. Breakfast was basic but adequate, some fruit juice would have helped, it can be taken on the rooftop or in your room.  AC was efficient as was room cleaning service.  Room service was prompt. After travelling we ordered some dosas from the Veg restaurant up the road which were delicious and arrived hot ! A 2 minute walk to Marine Drive and the Queens necklace, take a walk early evening and soak up the atmosphere with the locals. A 3 minute walk to Queensgate station and 15 minute walk to Colaba. No dining options within the hotel but plenty of good restaurants in walking distance. If you are a lover of seafood try Trishnas in the Fort area.
Thanks to all the staff for a very pleasant, hassle free stay.

Nice clean rooms excellent location.,5,2014-10,28-10-2014,"If you are OK with 70-80 older hotel like charm or prefer home like feeling over star hotel designer rooms, you'll like this hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean. Toilet is clean and no shortage of water (in Mumbai). AC , TV are as expected (in contrary to come older reviews). 
Now lets come to the location : Its located just opposite to 'The cricket club of Mumbai', 2 minute from Church-gate station and from my room i could see the sea. Everyday we spent time before and after dinner on Marine drive.
The breakfast is basic but that was fine with me. There are so many restaurants all around i don't think it is needed. We ordered tea coffee a number of times and it was delivered without delay. I have no complaints over service.
You may feel the cost is a little too much, but that's for the location i guess. I wont hesitate to stay in that hotel again if i visit one more time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r236854437-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,450,44343567,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/a4/a1/0f/kaushik-r.jpg,381,41,49,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaushikRC,KaushikRC,60C5161BF45AE05BAFCAF2AA732F07CB,,304558,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Kolkata (Calcutta),KaushikRC,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
"Good accommodation, great location",4,2014-09,13-10-2014,"The hotel is located just a stone throw away from Marine Drive. Although it's not palatial like a chateau, the hotel is in an Art-Deco building with 1950s furniture and caged lift. It's clean and comfortable. Wifi is available but charge-able. So I opted not to be connected to the internet for 2 nights before I moved on from Mumbai. You can choose to eat your breakfast either in your room or on the rooftop terrace. I chose to eat on the rooftop terrace - the view not that great - but it's all right, not too hot. The reception can also organize transport arrangements or excursions for you, and the prices are reasonable. Opposite the hotel is a pizza restaurant with a view of Marine Drive but you may want to eat in the air-conditioned area if you wish to get away from traffic noise.

NO VALUE FOR MONEY:- AVERAGE  HOTEL,3,2014-09,03-10-2014,"Our first preference was Subha Place. They offered us the rate almost the same as this hotel. Since, our Mumbai visit materialized at the last moment, we did not book that hotel. When we reached their, no room was available. Then, we have tried Residency Fort over phone they also didn’t had the room. The taxi driver took us to two other hotels which were not good.  
Under such circumstances, we decided to stay in Chateau Windsor. We stayed here for two nights in last week of sept.14 in their (We are family of four  2 adults and 2 Kids) quadrangle room  which they claim is for four persons, but is not. The fourth bed is a “sofa”, it is only a sleeper berth as one finds in the train. Room has no luxury and even the interior is not good. There is no tea/coffee maker in the room. The hotel is very old and very normal/basic. From outside its look like a apartment building with old style lift and reception on the 5th floor.  Hotel does not even have its own restaurant. It only provide a fixed breakfast which is two pieces of cutlet, two bread pieces with jam and butter, one banana with a tea or coffee. You may choose omelet/egg instead of cutlet, if you prefer non-veg. 
They do not provide any assistance on information on local attraction. They don’t have any brochure or information paper which they can provide to the customer. Staff is OK, not enthusiastic. 
No free Wifi , you have to pay Rs.60/- per half an hour for using wifi. The room tariff is very high in comparison to the facility and infrastructure. 
Location is good, b/f provided is average in taste, sleep in the night is peaceful.
 I would say that it’s not terrible or poor but very average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r232348292-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452391659,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,1200,33,28,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuptaMK,GuptaMK,B5BC13F1C21561088CAEF8347EE8F494,,304551,"New Delhi, India",New Delhi,GuptaMK,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

""" worst and most costly hotel of my whole trip!""",2,2014-09,26-09-2014,"Firstly this is my first time writting on trip advisor. But i think this deseves to be shared! I was staying here for 2 nights, but that was plently for me to know i would not be staying here again! The first day i was given a room on the top floor rooftop, it was the only room on the roof. It might sound glamorous but it really wasn't! After already having to pay for wifi for the day, only to find that my room is too far to recieve the signal, so i had to sit in reception to use the wifi i paid for as they wouldnt give me a refund. They told me a technitian was coming early the next morning to strenghten the signal, but this never happened. Also the aircon mashines are very old and make A LOT of noise, so much that i turned mine off and used the fan instead. Then at 9am there were two men painting the rooftop,very noisely outside my window, so i was awakened by this. 
After sitting in reception for almost an hour using my internet, they asked me if i would like to move to this floor as there was a room free'd up. I gladly excepted only to have an even worse night sleep ever! Firstly, same noisey aircon, so i used only the fan. Also there is an open window that you can't close in the toilet so mosquitos can easily fly in. Secondly there were not bed sheets cover, just a thick blanket type thing, which after using for 10min made me really itchy and im sure there were bed bugs in it. Therefore i spent, the small amount of sleep i had with my towel as a cover. Finally the worst part! At 6.30am this droney noise, the service staff are using the lift (an old gate lift -see photos) constantly, you can hear the lift going up and down the cables and the gates being pulled to and fro at this early hour. I got up and went to reception asking them to use the other lift at reception (away from rooms) or the stairs as it was loud n keeping me awake, but they just looked at me and the noise continues. So here i am, early in the morning writting my first ever post of tripadvisor as people really need to be aware of this. After 3 weeks travelling around India on a budget, this is the most expensive and worst hotel of my trip! However, the rest of India has been amazing!

We checked in at 3 am & all the night porters were extremely helpful. I would suggest paying a little extra for the superior room as it was comfortable & very clean. 
The service was excellent and everyone was helpful & polite. The man on reception was a little moody, but Raj was extremely informative & explained the whole train system.

"Great location, reasonable price",4,2014-08,30-08-2014,"The Chateau Windsor is a  good choice,  if you don't want to shell out big bucks for one of the glitzy, overpriced prestige places nearby. Our room was clean, quiet and comfortable. Effective and quiet A/C and ceiling fans, fridge, plasma TV, filtered water in the room. You can take breakfast in your room or on the plain but pleasant rooftop terrace. The room had the best shower we had in India.    It was an 'executive suite' which was perfect for our family of three adults and a teen, since it had a private alcove, where one of us slept,  off the main room.  The staff was exceptionally attentive and pleasant but in a non-intrusive way. Only steps away from CW are several really good restaurants, a handy grocery store, several chemists, the Asiatic 'department store', the  Marine Drive promenade, numerous fancier hotels and the Churchgate Station - where you watch the dabbahwallahs work and/or  take a local train (but not at rush hour!).

En España no pasa de una pensión,1,2014-07,05-08-2014,"Para empezar, la localización no está mal del todo, aunque hubiera sido deseable en ocasiones estar algo más cerca de los principales puntos de interés de la ciudad, hasta los cuales hay un paseito andando.

Nosotros ocupamos las habitaciones standar y superior y no encontramos apenas diferencias, salvo el precio y quizás el tamaño de la habitación (imagino que las de las fotos que se ven bien son las de luxe). Las camas no tienen sábanas para cubrirse, sino una colcha, por lo que da que pensar que las utilizan un cliente tras otro. Los colchones no están mal y las habitaciones se ven limpias. Sin embargo, su aspecto es anticuado y viejo. Tienen aire acondicionado y un ventilador, pero ambos hacen bastante ruido, por lo que si se es sensible a este, se encontrarán dificultades para conciliar el sueño. Además las habitaciones no están insonorizadas y las ventanas de aluminio y las endebles puertas dejan pasar todos los ruidos provinientes de la recepción, de otros clientes y sobre todo de la cocina, la cual no tiene ventanas, sino rejillas y da al patio interior de gran parte de las habitaciones, por lo que se oye nitidamente todo el ruido de platos y cubiertos desde muy temprano en la mañana hasta muy tarde en la noche.

Los baños también necesitan una reforma y las toallas de las manos son poco más grandes que una balleta de cocina. No esperéis muchos útiles de baño porque tan solo ponen jabón y un bote pequeño de gel. Así que mejor que los portéis vosotros.

Toda la inversión del hotel debe estar empleada en poner 4 personas abajo en la calle para saludar al llegar al cliente y para ofrecerles un taxi a la salida y muchos empleados por los pasillos y recepción, que tiene un aspecto más de oficina que de recepción de un hotel.

Además fuimos con todo pagado y se empeñaron en cobrarnos una ridícula tasa por el desayuno consistente en ""x"" rupias diarias (dependiendo de la inspiración del recepcionista o de lo poco o mucho que te quejes, o de si ese día hay monzón o no, no lo tenemos claro). El desayuno, por cierto, regularcillo, bastante sencillo (huevos, tostadas, mantequilla mermelada y cafe) aunque no es lo peor del hotel, desde mi punto de vista.

Comfortable and beautifully located,4,2014-06,27-06-2014,"My husband is a first-timer to India and coming from Australia for a holiday we weren't sure how the reviews of this hotel would correspond to our expectations. We shouldn't have worried  - this hotel was absolutely wonderful! The AC was excellent, the overhead fan helped to circulate the cool air (much needed in the early June heat of Mumbai), the bed was large and comfortable (though a bit hard for my husband), the included breakfast was fine and the attached bathroom was very good. We had room 436 with a balcony, towards the back of the building and very quiet. We were not looking for luxury, but this hotel with its admittedly modest facilities managed to give us a sense of deep comfort. The location was absolutely right for us too. A short walk leads to Marine Drive, lovely for watching the sunset in the evenings. Within walking distance (or a short cab ride) in the other direction leads to many attractions. We particularly enjoyed walking to the Gateway of India and the Prince of Wales museum and discovering great cafes (Kala Ghoda Cafe) and restaurants (Burma Burma). Don't miss the understated but lovely Resham Bhavan Tea Rooms near the hotel, which serves beautiful teas and meals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r212404557-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,2448,102201907,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/17/7a/33/irrawaddy0.jpg,3264,6,9,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irrawaddy0,irrawaddy0,52CE7A3845DE8B607A45253A36B1D925,,186402,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",Birmingham,irrawaddy0,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
Well sited and well run,4,2014-06,20-06-2014,"I obtained the name of the hotel in Mumbai from Trip Advisor and noted the reviews.  It was reasonably priced and near the sea but not on the coastal road.  The room was quite spacious with balcony.  Excellent aircon worked well and there was even an overhead fan.  A very comfortable bed with an excellent bathroom and good decor all made for a happy stay and the room service efficient.  The room was cleaned every day, bed made, sheets changed and the bathroom left in excellent order.  The security staff were extremely vigilant and polite and there was someone on duty at all times.

Pan Asian festival,4,2019-10,10-10-2019,"This review is about solitaire restaurant.
Pan Asian Food Festival’at The Solitaire Restaurant, Andheri from 25th September till 6th October.

We all know, how huge Asia is, and it is practically impossible to visit every country for a just culinary experience. So Kohinoor Continental is offering Pan Asian Food Festival along with top international cuisines made available under one roof.

The chef is Chef Jajo
Chef Jajo is a Pan Asian cuisine chef and has worked and gained experience cooking at Japanese restaurants for the last 10 years. 

Lunch 12:30 pm – 3:30 pm (Buffet)

Dinner 7.00 pm – 11:30 pm (Ala carte menu/TDH).

Now I come to my experience.

Service was good, but nothing great.

The food was very cold.

Sushis were very good and tasty.
There was live counter of sushi, momos and teriyaki.
All the three was nice.

Except that there was not much variety.

Nothing great for a festival.

But one thing I liked that the theme included few blackboard on which culinary scenes were dream with chalk.

Overall ok experience.

Average Hotel,3,2019-09,16-09-2019,"I spend 3 nights at the hotel, my issue with this hotel, it is very smoker friendly hotel, I was offered smoker room with double bed or a non smoker with 2 single bed, I insisted on non smoking double bed, which they eventually found it for me 
on the + side, friendly staff, nice reception area and bar 
on the - side, the place has smokers bedroom and a room designated  for the smokers, the room were out dated even my duvet cover smelt of tobacco !

I am non smokers, I do not have issue with smokers, but surely should not be allowed to smoke inside the hotel?  It is scientifically  proven  that  people who breath smoke can develop smoking related diseases 

The hotel is paradise for the smokers, i will not visiting this hotel again

Only location advantage - All else is worst,1,2015-06,18-06-2015,"Booked 2 rooms for 1 night through Travelguru.com. This is a very old hotel. Almost in a dilapidated state. The renovation work was going on. The reception and front block seem to be new and that is probably what they have uploaded on their website. Believe me, more than 90% of their rooms do not resemble even an iota of what you see on their website. The rooms are tiny. T.V was not working in either of our rooms. Window ac made a terrible sound through out. Cupboards were damp and stinky. The fridge was not working. Bathroom was of an average size. But they still have those cylinder sized geysers in their bathrooms. And age-old tiles and basins. The room had no exterior view. The breakfast spread was average. The taste was pathetic and puri was of the quality of leather. The only advantage the hotel has is probably its location. We did not take dinner or lunch. We instead enjoyed the food at the near by Sukh Sagar restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299362-r281182480-HOTEL_PARLE_INTERNATIONAL-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452391352,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,1200,5,6,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793pratikt,Pratik T,4821AA88B3E9098E4BD1DA2CE8872BA9,,297608,"Ahmedabad, India",Ahmedabad,793pratikt,,Front Office Manager,359227021,en,28-03-2016,Sunvan11,"Dear Sir,

a. Damn great location! Right next to the marine drive.

d. Perfectly safe!
e. Economical!

Cons:
a. You would be doubtful by the exterior looks that this was a hotel!!!
b. I don't remember exactly but there was little in terms of food. However, there are a couple of nice restaurants/bars etc at a walking distance.
c. Remember to take the renovated rooms only. The old ones are small and not that good.

I had stayed at this place for about 3-4 days about 2 years back. Always wanted to write about the great experience I had, just never got around to it!

good choice for tourist sights,4,2014-04,02-05-2014,"this hotel is located in a good part of mumbai - close to the touristic sights of mumbai / colabra area. The hotel is clean, tidy and comfortable - and acceptable for the price.

Value for money,5,2014-04,27-04-2014,"Stayed at the Chateau Windsor from 24th April for two nights.  I would definitely recommend this place;  All staff are prompt and willing to go that extra mile to ensure your stay is perfect.  We were not happy with the initial room allocated to us which was near the kitchen.  However the reception was more than happy to comply and immediately gave us a better room on the 02nd floor.

Rooms are clean and spacious.   As for room service the hotel has menus from various restaurants around the area; the reception is more than happy to order for you.
Location is perfect.  The only inconvenience I faced was while using the business centre to access my mails- they have only one printer which doubles up as a fax machine.  When we needed some prints in the night it just wouldn’t work and it was quite frustrating, but the staff made every attempt to help us out; which was appreciated.

All in all highly recommended.

"Wonderful location, Excellent value for Money",4,2014-04,07-04-2014,"Stayed 3 days back for 2 nights. It was our 2nd stay , the 1st was 8 years ago.
This stay was even better because the hotel has been renovated. Check in was smooth and fast. We had booked a triple seater room and were shown two rooms- 302 and 304. 302 was much bigger but the bathroom ( dedicated to 302) was in the corridor. We chose 304 which had an attached bathroom.
Very well renovated rooms. Very clean. Comfortable mattress.  No electric kettle in the room. But tea and snacks ( very limited menu )  and breakfast are served in the room as well as in the roof top restaurant.
There is a hair dryer in the bathroom.
The breakfast menu is fixed ( included in the room rent). Lunch and dinner are not served, but can be ordered from the innumerable eateries close by.
The staff are very helpful and polite.
The location is its USP. A stone's throw from Churchgate station and Marine drive, it is walking distance from many attractions. A walk along the sea is so easy due to its location.
Car parking is in the hotel compound itself, which is a luxury in Mumbai.
This hotel is excellent value for money.
We will happily stay here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r200214326-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,3672,123475602,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/5c/16/92/chitti.jpg,4896,41,83,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chitti,chitti,9D61D3388AA50BA748F3E950F45AEBAE,,,,,chitti,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php
Highly recommended,5,2014-03,01-04-2014,"Creaking up and down in an antiquated lift ""driven"" by a smiling attendant adds to the charm of this place.   Whilst it does not have the appearance of the average hotel, the location is nevertheless very convenient and wonderfully close to the seashore.   The service provided was wonderful, and any request was instantly dealt with by a very efficient young lady on the reception desk.   Room service could not be faulted.   We arrived in the early hours of the morning, and the receptionist was charming and prompt.

Convenient location but...,2,2014-01,08-03-2014,"We stayed there for 3 nights on January 2011. The hotel is situated on the upper floors of a large ugly building and in the entrance nothing reminds of a hotel. We felt a little bit worried but then the doorman accompanied us in an old fashioned elevator to the reception on the 4th or 5 th floor. Reception was like a public office but rooms were located on a renovated wing. Our room was spacious and clean, in a good condition but the bathroom was outside. It was a private bathroom but we had to go out on the hall to get access to it and this was quite annoying, since we were not informed about that when we made the reservation and since the price was not cheap too( about 80 euros per night). I asked for another room but they told me they hadn't anything available. Our room was also quite noisy, both from the main street and from lack of soundproof between rooms. We liked the rooftop were breakfast was served, because it offered some nice views to the city and the sea. Breakfast was simple(eggs, butter toast) but ok. The hotel is located in a very convenient location, in a walking distance from Mumbai's main attractions and just a few steps away from the marine road where you can have a pleasant walk in the evening, see the sunset, come across with local people and dine in one of many restaurants located on the marine drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r196613637-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,368,39490078,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/5a/92/1e/nikonas1976.jpg,550,97,77,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikonas1976,nikonas1976,6DD592C496DEE7F153000CAEF8AB8EE6,,189449,"Rhodes, Greece",Rhodes,nikonas1976,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

"Complimentary Buffet BF, Free airport drop and pick up, small rooms",4,2014-10,30-12-2014,"The rooms are small, but clean and well maintained.  They have free buffet breakfast - south indian, continental etc.  The hotel is 2-4 Km from the domestic and international airports and stone's throw from the Vile-Parle railway station.  Shops selling all kinds of things - from grocery to clothes are within walking distance.  Many restaurants and street food vendors are very very close.  Since room service food in this hotel is very very costly (and quality is so so), we always ate in one of the restaurants that are outside this hotel.  A few names that come to mind are - Jeevan, Ramakrishna and Shivsagar near the station, Mee Marathi opposite Parleshwar temple.

Pleasant Stay stone's throw away from the airport,4,2014-09,29-12-2014,"I stayed in this hotel for a night and found it nice. The hotel seems to be very old as they still have window AC; however maintained properly. Bathroom had a tub and modern amenities. Best thing is that they have hotel pick up and drop facility. My flight was delayed and i reached around 11:45pm but there was guy waiting for me to pick up.
The morning breakfast is typical south Indian and Maharastraian.

I would definitely stay in this place again.

Bitter sweet experience,3,2014-10,14-10-2014,"The vicinity to the Airport is the high point of the hotel. The airport transfers to and fro saves a lot of hassles.  The staff is friendly and efficient, but then this is very much expected in Mumbai.  The rooms were fairly clean, though cramped by the standards of the rates they charge.  

It is located in a nice suburb and one can always pop across the road for a quick meal. It is a business traveler  hotel, not for holidayers or family trips.  Most of the Mumbai hotels gives you a feeling of being  ripped off,  this is one of those hotels.  The breakfast was average.

Unprofessional staff at the front desk.,1,2014-08,30-08-2014,"So tonight i went in to chekout this hotel as i was looking for a place to stay for the night. Upon asking the front desk person (Mohammad Ali) to show me the room, he was polite enough to ask a bellman to show me a room. At the same time my partner had to use the restroom so she did and i went upstairs alone. After reaching the floor my first impression was as if i am in a HOSPITAL and thats exactly what it smelled like. So i came down and told the front desk person that i dont think so i would be staying in a hospital and paying Rs 7000 for a night which he coated me in the first place. Upon me telling him that it smelled like hospital his first comment was if you wanted to use the washroom you should have asked me instead making up excuses. What kind of professional way is this to treat your customers, i have been working in hotel industry for the past 7 years and have never come across such rude and arrogant front desk person.

OK place for a business meetiing,3,2014-05,25-05-2014,"Stayed there for 3 nights for a business meeting in the hotel. The pick up and drop were well done, co-ordinated and efficient. The rooms were OK for the location, would be good for business travel. The conference halls we got were congested, not spacey and the ambiance OK. Lots of companies seem to be doing the residential training there, so tends to get too crowded. Checked with them about the gym, they said, under renovation, so you need to go out for a walk  if you want to really work out. They have a bar, next door, a restaurant, all OK  for business. Would not be ideal for a family stay or for peace and quiet.

The Rooms are Spacious, Clean and Super Comfortable. Friendly Staff, Great Value for Money, Location, Interior, Washroom, Terrace - Everything Furnished with Taste, a Sense of Quality and Comfort. The complementary Breakfast has good menu and it was tasty- Great Cuisine.
Lord Ganapati at the entrance got attracted the most. Impressed by the tiniest of tiny things here.
Though, all the amenities were available like Swimming Pool, Free Wi-Fi, etc. I couldn’t use it to give a comment. Only request is to keep an affordable price, especially to the middle class people- like me; So that, they too can experience the beautiful ambience of Kohinoor Continental.

"Fantastic location, hotel has ""character"".",3,2014-02,10-02-2014,"Had gone for the Kala Ghoda festival, and this hotel was located right next door. It's in any case located superbly. My third floor room, though small, was decent, with a clean bathroom. Loved the old style lift, which functioned surprisingly efficiently. Service though is a bit slow, and the coffee arrives cold...why no coffee maker in the rooms? It was overall, charming, with the reception on the fifth floor and the rooms below...a reversal! 
One can order food from a variety of restaurants located nearby. Quaint, but not bad. 
THe place is functional, rather than luxurious, and clean. 
The reception was very helpful when I discovered that I had left the charger of my cellphone behind. The girl there realized that her charger would fit my phone, and smilingly charged mine when required!

Good Budget Hotel,4,2014-02,08-02-2014,"Stayed 5 nightshere during February 2014. Hotel was worth the money paid. Although the rooms on the 1st floor are much nicer. We had the family room on the fifth floor room number 515. This room was very near to the kitchen and so became very noisy very early in the morning. 

The room itself was good with nice 4 beds for a family to sleep. Bathroom was well tiled and clean and hot water was always available. Rooms were cleaned daily and fresh towels replaced everyday. Air conditioning was working to perfection. Nice sized tv and a fridge was available.  The safety deposit box wasnt working in our room and never required it so never complained.

Breakfast was not like wow but was enough to take you through till lunch time.
Location of hotel is good with taxis readily available. Not in a very noisy area of Mumbai. Train station was just a stones throw away if you are one of those who like to travel by train.

Overall it was a good stay. Would Recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a budget hotel.

"Good location, clean but no free wifi?!",3,2013-12,12-12-2013,"This hotel is above average - good, but I wouldn't say very good. It is centrally located, a short drive away from the main area around Leopold's and everything in the room works very well and is very clean. the whole building isn't a hotel - the hotel is a few floors within what seems to be a normal apartment block. This gives it a very different feel - no lobby/ reception area, Restuarant etc. as one walks in. The reception area is on the 4th floor. The reason I don't score it higher is because one pays for wifi by the hour (1 hour coupons sold) and it doesn't have the full look, feel and facilities of a hotel.

Excellent Hotel,4,2012-12,18-11-2013,"I stayed in this Hotel for 3 nights and four Days in Oct 2012. The entrance was pretty deceptive but when we saw the rooms we were atually in awe. The location could not have been more perfect. 200m from Marine drive was all we could walk towards. The bathroom was also fantastic. There was no restaurant at this hotel at that time but the Breakfast they provided was excellent and perfectly priced. Moreover what I loved was the Staff, From the lift-man to the managers to the waiters, all were extremely good. I would definitely go back to this hotel if I am on a non business trip.

Neem GEEN superior room!,4,2013-08,07-08-2013,"Uiteindelijk hebben we aan dit hotel een goede ervaring overgehouden, maar het begin was niet goed. Terwijl we een Deluxe kamer hadden geboekt, werden we (onwetend) in een 'superior room' geplaatst. Deze kamer had meer weg van een slagers hok, met tegels als muurdecoratie in plaats van behang of verf. Totaal sfeerloos en niet aan te raden voor het bedrag wat je betaalt. 

Toch maar even de receptie gevraagd of ze dit een Deluxe room vonden, toen bleek dat ze onze boeking (via hotels.com) hadden aangezien als een superior room. Eerst vonden ze dat ik zelf maar contact op moest nemen met hotel.com (ook al liet ik de emailbevestiging zien waarop duidelijk 'Deluxe room' stond), maar nadat ik hier geen genoegen mee nam en bleef staan ging de receptioniste toch maar even bellen.

Uiteindelijk bleek dat ze verkeerd gekeken had en liet ze me twee Deluxe rooms zien. Dat was echt een wereld van verschil met de superior room (superieur waaraan die kamer was wisten ze zelf ook niet) en opgelucht haalde ik en m'n vriendin adem. Voor het geld wat we hadden betaald (70 EUR per nacht) was de Deluxe room ook wat we vooraf hadden verwacht. 

De superior room kost maar 7-8 EUR per nacht minder, maar dat geld was het meer dan waard.

De service was verder prima en we mochten op de dag van vertrek, bij het ophalen van de bagage die daar opgeslagen lag, zelfs even een kamer gebruiken om ons om op te frissen (het had erg geregend).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d325614-r171170488-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,1200,452390416,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,1200,26,31,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geert83,Geert83,7EA78101A5107531CC16E7CC091E92B2,,188590,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Amsterdam,Geert83,,,,,,,,"86 Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai 400020 India",Mumbai,India,400020,Maharashtra,86 Veer Nariman Road,,325614,18.933601,"Mumbai, Maharashtra",72.82524,Chateau Windsor Hotel,534,3.9,16,26,95,251,146,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d325614-Reviews-Chateau_Windsor_Hotel-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,http://www.chateauwindsor.com/bookings/hr_index.php

Great location and very comfortable stay,5,2013-03,26-07-2013,"I stayed at Chateau Windsor Hotel during my last 3 visits to India over the past 5 years. I often reminisce about the lovely mornings I spent on the terrace; reading the newspaper (that gets delivered every morning to each room) while sipping on  some tea or coffee. The few items that the breakfast menu has to offer is enough to provide good sustenance for most of the day.  The hotel staff (from the front desk to kitchen to cleaning) are very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is immaculately clean. If you’re feeling lazy, the hotel also places food orders from neighbouring restaurants on your behalf, has them collected, plated and delivered to your room! The hotel’s vicinity is great, with a supermarket, several restaurants, beauty parlours, clothing stores, departmental stores, railway station, etc. just a stone’s throw away. Down the road, the Marine Drive promenade is perfect for strolling, exercising or simply admiring nature’s beauty at any time of the day.

Surprisingly nice,4,2013-07,21-07-2013,"We booked here because of the location, and the price (we needed three rooms to accommodate our large family).

I was so pleasantly surprised to see what a nice hotel it was.  There is no lobby per se, and very little in the way of amenities.  However the rooms were very, very clean (you can request daily cleaning), staff more than accommodating (we did tip them as they came and went as I don't think perhaps management distributes the tips from the central ""tip box"") and the Churchgate location is fantastic.  Staff at front door entrance will answer any questions you have (all speak some English), direct you, advise you of going tariffs for taxis, etc.  Safe and secure,,,and if you can upgrade to best rooms available they are almost luxury quality for a really budget price.  Only peeve we had was housekeeping phones (loud!) that rang often in hallway, but never at night.

"Value for money, for its location.",4,2013-05,14-05-2013,"Firstly, South Mumbai is not the cheapest of places. Therefore paying for a hotel room around $75 to $100 is very reasonable. Having extensively researched hotels in South Bombay this is best place for under $100. 
However if Staying in South Bombay is not a priority, then you can certainly get a lot better place for your money in the suburban areas ( If you book early enough you can stay at the Sofitel in Bandra for under $125 ).

When we arrived at Chateau Windsor I was shocked at the simplicity (as my mum had booked it) However, it was perfectly clean, the staff were sweet and friendly, we would order tea to the room and it would arrive quite promptly. The decor is dated, but for £40/50ish a night I cant really complain - especially as it was for 3 of us sharing a room!

Overpriced but comfortable enough,3,,09-05-2013,"Having heard that mumbai was very expensive for decent accommodation we ensured that we budgetted enough to be certain of a bedbug free and comfortable hotel. Whilst this hotel met both of these requirements it still came up short given that we paid over £50 per night for our stay.

Our room, on the roof, appeared to be an after thought and felt fairly 'hut like'. The decor was tired, the bathroom miniature and towels ratty. Particularly annoying was the air con, which rattled like an old fashioned bus and kept us awake.  After time spent in thailand, cambodian and vietnam this really felt substandard and we feel that the trip adviser reviews to date (which informed our decision to book) misrepresent the value on offer. 

The front of house staff manning the desk were also disappointing. At no point did we feel welcome at the hotel and we also felt that our requests for help (such as whether we could book trains at churchgate) were incovenient to the hotel as we were effectively waved away. 

The porters were far nicer and managed to smile, though we did at times feel uncomfortable when they loitered for tips. In a budget hotel when the services are standard i don't feel that it is appropriate to tip on every occasion.

The breakfast was standard and, if not included in the room, is a bargain at 60 rupees. Other drinks were similarly good value.  The Roof terrace was also pleasant.

Overall we feel a bit ripped off by the hotel (especially the 1350 rupee pick up!!). Im not sure of the general standard in mumbai but for £50 a night id expect at least friendlier service.

Excellent arrangement,5,2019-07,29-07-2019,Booked a room for 27th night . Then i got in touch with the manager Mr Pawan Agarwal as i had to make some arrangements for birthday celebration.  He was so helpful . He arranged for a cake and i asked him if he can arrange for some balloons and he arranged for that as well and everything was arranged in the room as per my requirements and on time . Since we checked in late in the night he gave me a late checkout as well.

The Associates Make The Difference!,5,2019-07,28-07-2019,"A fabulous stay with utmost warmth and hospitality exhibited by the team at the hotel. I always look forward to returning to this hotel.

I checked in late night and was extremely tired after a long day. I was greeted by a familiar face Kajmeer at the reception who was extremely polite & warm. Anticipating my arrival he ensurred all the required check-in formalities very kept ready before I reached , thus minimising my time spent at the reception.

Check-In was swift!

On departure I was met by Pawan who is ever so warm and accomodating. It's always a pleasure to have long, meaningful conversations with him on varied topics. His client handling / soft skills is something to commend. As a guest you can see that skill being taught / passed on to other members in the team.

Gaurav in the lobby restaurant was a gem to interact with. He suggested the right dishes to kick-start my day.

The hotel feels premium in the lobby , however looses it's charm once you go upstairs. The rooms are run down / outdated and are in need of renovation.

The associates/team working here is what distinguishes this hotel from others. 

Looking forward to returning soon in the near future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d482013-r693367477-Hotel_Kohinoor_Continental-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,,,,,4,6,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arjunmenon04,Arjun Menon,7C77F0351DBE78134543C452B5CD2E58,,,,,Arjunmenon04,,Vice President – Hotels Division,693977838,en,30-07-2019,HotelKohinoorMumbai,"Dear Guest,

Definitely not four star,3,2019-04,24-04-2019,"Booked a room from the 23rd of April until the 24th of April. It was supposed to be a superior room. The staff was friendly, and quite professional. The room and the bathroom looked very dated and looked okay, but far from a four star hotel room. I have stayed in different five and four star hotels, and can without any doubt say that this room did not meet the standards of a four star hotel. Close to the airport, but the charge that the hotel charges you to get to the airport (2.2km) is about 600 INR without tax which is outrageous. It is more than 250 Rs per km after you consider the airport charge. Unbelievable. Just take an Uber or Uber XL which we did in the end.

Good and convenient Hotel,4,2019-04,19-04-2019,Stayed at this hotel between 02 April to 05 April 2019. The Hotel is very well located just under the Metro Station with plenty of taxi and auto rickshaws around to commute. The hotel is very clean and nice. This was my 4-5th visit to this hotel. The rooms are quite large with all toileteries and tea coffee and a mini fridge as well. The room service was good. Ordered dinner in the room and the food was very tasty. The buffet breakfast spread was big and tasty with North and South Indian and Continental cuisines. The reception and the coincierge had smiles. Will stay here again on my next visit to Mumbai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d482013-r667573669-Hotel_Kohinoor_Continental-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,,300,276175989,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/76/1c/75/sanjay-s.jpg,300,118,239,www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanjay1960,Sanjay S,436D4F0028456F865A60499C22967B95,,297586,"Hyderabad, India",Hyderabad,Sanjay1960,,Vice President – Hotels Division,668226861,en,21-04-2019,HotelKohinoorMumbai,"
