"Disappointing stay at this Srinagar hotel.","1","2025-04","2025-04-13","I had a disappointing experience at this hotel Batra in Srinagar. The staff was uncooperative, and the management seemed ineffective. Specifically, I had issues with Irshad, who was particularly unhelpful.

"Unprofessional Higher Management","1","2024-12","2024-12-08","When I booked Hotel Batra, I assumed that the hotel will have some standards and I will have a comfortable stay.  When I checked-in, I was amazed to see how Ms.Asima handled the conversation and I immediately felt comfortable with the two lovely ladies at the Front Office.  My stay was comfortable with the cordial staff, more so my everyday interaction with the ladies at the FO.  To further clarify, me as a single woman staying at the hotel, I had many inhibitions; but, Ms.Asima and Ms.Bismah really made me feel relaxed.  They treated me more than a guest.  However,  today, i.e. on 7th December my check-out was a nightmare.  It completely overshadowed my lovely stay and I left with a horrible impression of Hotel Batra.  While checking out, by mistake the FO charged the extra 5k of advance that I had paid earlier.  Mistakes happen and we all are humans.  Infact to err ìs human.  I wasn't that worried coz I knew that there are official procedures to handle this, for instance a 'paid out voucher' is all they needed.  Which the management lied to me saying that they don't have the authority on anything.  FYI, I belong to the hotel industry and we know all the processes.   The management thought I was a foolish guest.  To make things worse, I immediately heard a loud bang on the wall of the Front Office.  I was taken aback and when Ms. Bismah turned around to go to  the next door, I realized somebody called out.  Ohmygod! Which manager calls out an employee, with a loud bang on the wall??? I was a guest standing, any many others were walking in to take the lift.  Then I hear Ms.Asima being called in.  And at the top of his voice, some bloody manager yelled at the girls asking them to leave the work and go.  I and other guests could hear the whole conversation in the lobby.  Then I see the girls coming out in tears.  All this for bloody 5k??? My questions to the General Manager of the hotel are:
-If these girls have done a mistake, what did the Operations Manager do??? He has completely spoiled the reputation of your hotel.
-If women are treated like this in a workplace, what hospitality can you provide the guests, especially women? Which means I can also be ill treated any time.
-How dare the OM shout at the girls, but did not have the guts to come and talk to me? 
-Is this how your lower staff is treated in the hotel? Then, why is he an OM?  He doesn't deserve that position.
I wanted to get inside and give him a piece of my mind, but the girls at the FO requested me not to.  Ms.Asima could not even face me and talk.  If this isn't a terrible thing, then what is?
My last impression of my stay is unbelievably horrible.  I was supposed to come back this month end to stay again.  But I shall not, and I shall also ask my friends and family never to stay at Hotel Batra again.  With a hope that action will be taken against the OM, if not hospitality is just a word which is unpracticed.  This unprofessional behavior should not be let gone.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r983600039-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452361217","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghazalat2019","ghazala t","296A6CEB4CE574F9B062C259BC7D92DA",,,,,"ghazalat2019",,,,,,,,"Pure Vegetarian Hotel Durganag, Dalgate, Dallake, Srinagar 190001 India","Srinagar","India","190001","Jammu and Kashmir","Pure Vegetarian Hotel","Durganag, Dalgate, Dallake","3653779","34.07521","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.83158","Batra Hotels And Residences","643","4.4","35","16","42","130","420","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d3653779-Reviews-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","https://www.batrahotelsandresidences.com/"

The variety offered was also appreciable. Special thanks to Sajjad, Tanveer and team for taking good care of us.

The staff at the Welcome Hotel were incredibly helpful and polite, ensuring that all our needs were met with a smile. Their warm hospitality truly made our stay a memorable one. Additionally, the food at the hotel was delicious, offering a variety of flavorful dishes that catered to all our tastes.The menu is expensive.  The F & B staff were so courteous .

"Relationships beyond Business","5","2025-04","2025-04-24","Dear Top Management of Welcome Hotel Group,

Warm Greetings,

I am delighted to address this mail to you. Me and my family stayed in your hotel at Srinagar between 14 to 16 April 2025 (3 Nights) . It was not only a comfortable stay but very happy and lively too.

Right from the start at the front desk, service staff, bell boys everyone was smiling, welcoming and eager to help. Both my daughters took liking towards Mr Masroor Ali, who in turned was very warm and a good story teller (a must quality for a Hotelier)

The breakfast and dinner spread was good and adequate. The service staff did not mind running back and forth for Chappaties / Sabjji's.

However the highlight of our experience was on  19 April 2025. Thanks to SpiceJet they cancelled the flight at the very last moment. My daughters were alone at the Airport from 3 pm in the afternoon to almost midnight. 

Our local support Mr Jimmy was a saviour, he not only carried something to eat but dropped them to the Welcome hotel. Mr Nikhil (Traveniti, Hubali, Karnatak. Our booking company) was the key to coordinate  and supervise the movement of my daughters right from the time the airlines started delaying the flight until they reached the hotel, as well as the following day until they reached Bangalore their destination.

The hotel  staff was kind enough to find a room for them to stay, in spite of the hotel running full. Once they reached the Hotel we as parents were so relieved. Both my daughters were pleased, and found home at your property. The next day they were dropped off at the airport post breakfast. We were told the hotel was going to hold rooms until they take off and reach Delhi. That was so thoughtful of them.

I, along with my family, will always be grateful to everyone at your hotel.  This will be a lifetime of memories.

Thank you everyone, once again

I strongly recommend that you recognise this effort by your staff. May you always get the best resources and your enterprise prosper and achieve many milestones.

We had few problems related to bathroom blockage but hats off to the entire staff who spontaneously fixed the problems in no time.

The only advice to the management is to regularly check the bathroom blockage and room electrical switches as few of them were not in working condition in our Business Suite Room. Also the bathrooms should have exhaust fans installed.

The service and hospitality was also very good. They listened to all our requests and solved it promptly.

I want to especially thank the below people for their service:
At reception, Saqib was very helpful and guided us very well. They gave us interconnected rooms since we were a family of 5 (room 308 and room 309).
The waiter Sajjad was very sweet and helpful and always greeted us with a smile.
And thanks to chef Nissar for the delicious food.

"Good location! Slow service!","4","2023-12","2023-12-31","
Very good location with (veg)restaurants and shops close by but the staff behaves like they are  either too lazy or they don't care about the customers.
Pros:
- Located centrally, walkable to  Dal gate and 5 min ride to lal chowk market.
- Heater/AC in the room works well - hot water only available at certain hours in the morning n evening but was not an issue
- room was big and spacious 
- Decent spread and variety in the bf and dinner buffet . 
- 
Cons:
 - the staff was very slow at everything we asked. We had to ask twice for towels , twice for hot water in the bathroom, many times to get a cab arranged for sightseeing. They do provide the service but we had to reach out multiple times
- housekeeping does not replace toiletries or the bedsheets. We had to ask on the second day for these else they would just clean the floor and set the bed. They don't provide basic things like a door mat outside the bathroom and they gave us wet towels when we asked on one day
- if the room is road facing there is traffic noise from the road.

I noticed strangely no one offered to help with the baggage during checkout. That was not a problem but in Kashmir generally people like hotel staff and watchmen are behind you for tips but that did not happen here.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r931858723-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452390416","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","1200","20","42","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RishiSB","Rishi S","335AAAF74C96AF3EA3481D6BF059E92F",,,,,"RishiSB",,"General Manager","931892594","en","2024-01-01","Jaydeep Bhat","Dear Guest,

"Unfortunate booking @ Jamal Resorts","1","2021-10","2021-10-14","First of all, thank God for saving us from staying at this place! We had booked this resort through MakeMyTrip, totally falling for the handsome, spic & span pictures that the resort have posted everywhere and trusting that stuff eventually! I had specifically written to them in an email what exactly I was looking for, why this trip was important for us but all that seemed to have had no affect whatsoever when we finally arrived here all the way from Pahalgam. We had our ageing father with us for whom this whole trip was planned and when we were shown into our room, we were in for a rude shock. I am not saying that its not a nice property. The property itself is good enough but it would seem that someone somewhere in the management is no longer paying enough attention to little details. Room was small, smelly and nothing like what they have shown on their online pictures. Room was not very clean, had a faint overpowering damp smell and strictly not worth my hard earned money. 
If it hadn't been for the kind service of MakeMyTrip who were kind enough to refund my money one hundred percent, I would have been at a total loss. So we cancelled our booking there and then and left.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r814535093-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452389554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","7","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoneWolf_Saini","Berinnderr Singh","097ED792D2600BB09BEDA423931C0D4E",,,,,"LoneWolf_Saini",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

"totally unprofessional and rude attitude","1","2021-07","2021-07-15","very much rude and unprofessional attitude. As per hotel staff their policy states to have food at common place by buffet service. When question was raised why such rules are followed at times of COVID they argued that they will follow their policy and social distancing would be maintained Also the staff was so arrogant that he proposed if meal was served at room we would be charged for food and services , which was already being paid beforehand.And real time no covid protocol was followed. We have to check out after 1 night where we had booking for 2 nights. There are lots of other hotels at Srinagar,please don't go and spoil your holiday. Plus they keep on calling to delete the review in return they will provide free staying and touring from their behalf

No one came to collect room service plates for 24 hours 
Rooms are decent 
Stayed in Room 204 WiFi connection was not working as it is last room 
As the Room is above the kitchen there was lots of noise till late in night due to cleaning work going on.

"Family may be.. Not for solo...","3","2017-08","2017-09-03","I booked this hotel as it says 1km from dal lake and it's walking distance. However it's on the other side of the lake where no shikara rides or any activities take place. I paid 950/- for prepaid taxi from airport. It is that far. The resort is close to Nishat Garden and is almost outskirts of the active locality. Being a solo traveller the location proved to my disadvantage as I had to take rickshaw to visit TRC and Dal Lake and enede up paying a good chunk of money. Also the sharing cab people won't pick you up from this place.
The manager scared me off the very first minute I check in by saying there are no sharing rides from Srinagar to Leh. Anyways other staff seemed helpful.
Room was clean and good. Best part of the stay was the bed though. Very relaxing.

"Amazing property","5","2017-08","2017-08-03","I had a comfortable stay with my family. The staff was helpfull. It's close to the dal lake walking distance. There is a guitar gang and shiv templecright outside the hotel which many people would not even know about and is not listed on the tourist places to see. So that was a highlight. There is a good market where we could shop for kesar and walnuts. I got the walnuts at 700 kg. The white looking walnuts are fresh. Kesar for 200. And almonds for 750 kg. Kewah for 200 rs thought it would help for those who are interested nothing more than that. Do not take autos take sharing three wheelers who take you to dal gate for 20rs. And over all we had a great stay. Srinagar had many myths such as it's not safe. I could jog around the whole city. Like in many sense it was like any other city. Though they show srinagar band stories on TV which is not true. As it was normal. But we need to be aware at all times.over all decent stay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r508588080-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452388731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","2","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mobile724617","Mobile724617","95183CCEB2E032A4BDD33DA0AAC68AB0",,,,,"Mobile724617",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

"Enjoyable Stay","5","2023-10","2023-10-05","We stayed with our family (5 + 1) for 4 days (01 Oct - 04 Oct-23) and it was definitely a pleasant one.

Staff at the reception (Muzafar, Moonesa & Tahir), 

Room Service (Nadeem, Irshad and one more) and 

Restaurant (Sajjad & Imran) were all very courteous and supportive.

They all made sure that our stay was quite enjoyable with their pleasing manners and service.

Big plus for choosing this one is, it's 100 % Vegetarian. Restaurant served a variety of delicious dishes, both for Breakfast and Dinner.

Batra Hotels, Srinagar is definitely value for money in our view.

Would strongly recommend to all families going on a vacation to Srinagar.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r919963336-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine07994823812","Sunshine07994823812","F597339FB0B50A57B7DC75C78389735C",,,,,"Sunshine07994823812",,"General Manager","920127147","en","2023-10-06","Jaydeep Bhat","Dear Guest,

The property itself is clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, but what really made the experience special was the staff. From check-in to check-out, every team member I interacted with was warm, professional, and genuinely helpful.

The front desk staff greeted me with a smile and made the process smooth and quick. Housekeeping kept the room spotless every day, and the restaurant staff went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and well taken care of.

Their attentiveness, kindness, and willingness to help with even the smallest requests truly stood out. It’s rare to see such a consistent level of hospitality across the whole team, and it made me feel right at home.

Highly recommend this hotel—not just for the facilities, but for the amazing staff who make the stay memorable.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d13187697-r1024910073-Radisson_Hotel_Srinagar-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getaway36298174344","Getaway36298174344","EFA9408F7059088E7779C6A79B7B456F",,,,,"Getaway36298174344",,"General Manager","1025049677","en","2025-08-18","Radisson Srinagar","Dear Guest,

The hotel manager transferred us to thier new wing which was told to us that it is only 5 mins away from the main hotel but in reality it was 30 mins away. When we reached the new wing to our shock we found that it was actually a guest house / servant quarters for thier staff which had no security no restaurant no dinning place no facility at all. I was travellling with an infant baby and hence i refused to stay at such an unsafe place. The hotel manager was highly pathetic man . He refused to give refund as well. AT 10.00 p.m. at night in srinagar we managed to find another hotel and moved out of this hell hotel. We will Never visit this place again . Infact the hotel needs to be sued for such criminal acitivities.

"Worst hospitality","1","2016-03","2016-04-09","Hey guys,
If your choosing this place for a vacation I am sure your gonna end up standing in the streets of Srinagar or at-least in one roofless shelter in that freezing cold. Kindly take my review seriously as its my Family's experience

I must warn you about Jamal resorts n makemytrip & co
I had been to Srinagar recently with my close knitted family group of 20 which comprised of just two men n d rest were women n children. We had booked jamal resorts thru makemytrip and had the confirmation mail also. 

1- We had booked 3 moths prior to our trip @ normal prices but I guess as d season started earlier they gave our booked rooms for better deals n asked us to go to another place they suggested..

2- when asked about it both makemytrip and Jamal resorts incharges didn't respond properly. They kept blaming each other. 
3 - we payed them but after long arguments n a few hours of standing in the cold my family  had to compromise and stay in a different hotel
4 - worst responses and hospitality. Literally money oriented and Fraudism 
 Comorade Inn only accommodated us later and they were gud in all means :)
Most important on that same day and tym we faced this problem two other families had the same issues and were sent to different places. And one of them had also prebooked through makemytrip.

Nice Property
24X7 hot water (not in all room though)

Very dim lights in the room
Toiletries could be better
Room service could be more quick
Annoying smell in the restaurant & in the paper cup

"Huge Property and No Service..","2","2015-10","2016-03-08","First we were provided a room where there was a stingy foul smell which didnt go even after using different kind of sprays.
Second, I found a huge spider on the wall..I mean really bad. After trying for a long time with those sprays etc, they werent able to take it out and left it there.
Third, The dish connection in our TV didnt work even after being told that they recharged it twice.
Then when i opened the water tap in bathroom, the water started streaming out of geyzer which was applied there with all open wires.
Finally after so many complaints and to the danger of electrocution, they changed our room (upgraded one) showing us like they were doing us a big favour.
Well to our surprise, the ""upgraded"" room had its own faults too. With half of the Switches not working or the intercom.
Then again, the dish was not working either, even after recharge which they told us that they did. When we told that its not possible to not have dish if you have recharged it. Then to my utter surprise,they tell us that they couldnt do it and also ""How does cable matter, you can sleep by 12, till that time, it will work"".
I am giving 2 stars only because breakfast was good. Other than that, nothing. Disappointing experience.

"Disappointing.","1","2016-01","2016-01-06","We stayed there for 1 night and were not very pleased with the whole experience. Looks OK from outside and lobby is clean too. The rooms are tiny and very dimly lit. Bathrooms too very dimly lit. The faucets, the fittings almost everything needed repair. The whole furniture in the room needed repair. Drawers had their handles broken, ply sticking out etc. Had to call room service about 3 times only to get them to bring us a electric kettle. 
The food was sub standard. Dinner was way too spicy. Soup had so much chilly, none of us could finish even half a bowl. The remaining items in the buffet were the same. B'fast had very little options, and was served cold. The restaurant furniture too was totally dilapidated. 
Not recommended.

I went to check with the reception to my dismay it was locked and no one available. On a winter night with a proper heater imagine the plight of my family. Even the food was not good.

"Huge property centrally located near Dal make.","3","2015-12","2015-12-30","Good things-
I found it better place with large area than all hotels in nearby area.

Service is good.

Cleanliness scores high.

Near by places to visit would b Dal lake, Shikara ride, shalimar garden, mughal garden,shoping areas and restaurant.

In same campus they have their store for exquisite carpet,saree shawl,dry fruits and all handlooms.good place to see around and do some handicraft shopping from Jamal industries high standard manufacturing.bit pricy though.

Rooms are well equipped with LED TV,restaurant, heater,tea maker,cupboards and beautiful decorated beds with bed heater.

Things to improve-
Room sizes are just okay not very spacious.

Not much view from window as houses are around.

Food is just alright.

Power backup needs to be improved.

The Restaurant is fairly large & well furnished. The Washrooms are also very clean (despite the shabby entrance door) & the Wash Basins have running Hot & Cold Water, which is a blessing to prevent your fingers from Freezing when you wash your hands. The food is good. We tried the Kashmiri Wazwan Waza Chicken with Butter Nan, Tawa Roti & Gulab Jamuns - it was very good. The Waza Chicken & Butter Nan were both very good. The prices are also very reasonable & the service though a bit slow, is good as the waiters are quite polite & helpful. There is also adequate parking available, so that's another plus point.

"A complete disaster & overpriced","1","2025-04","2025-04-28","What was supposed to be a relaxing end to a two weeks road trip turned out to be quite the opposite.

Few hours after checking in, and having a relaxing time in room, I received a call from reception advising to vacate the room due to maintenance issues with the AC and warm water.  Of course this was very inconvenient but eventually managed to get all my packing sorted, and out I went.

Once at my new room, which was suppose to be an ""upgrade"", but turned out to be exactly the same room category but in a much worse condition..I chose to accept it.  Unpacked my luggage for a second time, and eventually managed to settle in a relax mode.  One hour later I was going for a bath and turned on the water and out poured disgusting muddy brown and smelling wanter!  Picked up the phone, dialled reception and asked for the manager to come to inspect.  He did, and once again I found myself packing up and vacating the room.

This time, I had to wait downstairs while another suitable room was getting located...which eventually they found - my original room I initially had checked in too!!  Turned out there was nothing wrong with it to begin with!!!

So few hours later, after tons of inconvenience and frustration, I was back in my original room.

All I got for the hassle, was a free meal at the restaurant, which was nothing compared to what I went through.  The restaurant experience was also not without faults.  There were too many staff on the floor without enough work to do, so they all gathered around the wait station and having a social hang out, which was also right next to my table where I am trying to enjoy my meal in relaxation - but instead I have to listen to their loud conversation and laughters....very professional!!  To top it up, exactly the same thing next morning at breakfast service also!

All of this for a very crazy overpriced hotel!

A complete unacceptable experience.  I have been a Radisson VIP member for years, and this is without doubt the worse I have had to experience!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d13187697-r1004731690-Radisson_Hotel_Srinagar-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"300","315818560","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/d3/02/40/nbison.jpg","300","116","207","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicklasNavin","NicklasNavin","46E9F42307D4749B53D712D97C14AFFD",,"189852","Stockholm, Sweden","Stockholm","NicklasNavin",,,,,,,,"11 Maulana Azad Road, Srinagar 190001 India","Srinagar","India","190001","Jammu and Kashmir","11 Maulana Azad Road",,"13187697","34.076355","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.82206","Radisson Hotel Srinagar","2036","4.5","86","45","108","242","1555","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d13187697-Reviews-Radisson_Hotel_Srinagar-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/radisson-srinagar"

"Spectacular view of Dal Lake from this lakefont hotel","5","2025-02","2025-02-18","It was my wife's first trip to Kashmir and I wanted us to stay at a place overlooking the Dal Lake. Welcome Hotel turned out to be just perfect.

Ghat no 7 was right across the hotel and every evening it was convenient to walk across to the lake and sit by its side, soaking in its beauty. The view of the lake from our room was nothing short of spectacular and although the lakefront rooms are higher priced I think it was money well spent.

The room was really spacious and well done. The restaurant had a great array of options, the food was yummy and for a change I found a hotel where I didnt have complaints about housekeeping and service in general.

Overall, 26 years after marriage our stay at Welcome will go down for us as one of the most memorable ever.

"Great Hospitality and Fresh Delicious Vegetarian Food served lovingly","5","2023-03","2023-04-02","I, and my family of 4 stayed at the Batra Hotel in Srinagar for 5 nights from March 25 onwards. We stayed in Srinagar and went to Gulmarg and other places as day excursions.

We made our bookings well in advance with the General Manager, Mr. Jaydeep Bhat. We met him in person during our stay and it was wonderful talking to him everyday.  He extended a lot of warmth and affection to the entire family.  He guided us well, he was very co-operative,  and offered great hospitality. 

A special mention about Mr. Ashish Sharda, the rooms division manager who smilingly assisted us in all our requirements.  He made sure we have a really comfortable stay at the hotel.  
Room Tip: They have connecting room options for families. We had 2 connecting rooms for us. 

Mr. Bashir Ahmed, along with his team including Wasim and Haroon in the food and beverages section served us everyday with a smile on their face and a lot of love.

A highlight of this hotel is its freshly prepared delicious vegetarian spread.  We enjoyed the food everyday which was served to us with great love. They used to come and serve piping hot rotis on our table. Kahwa was simply amazing. The food at the hotel is absolutely worthy of every praise possible. 
Plan Tip: We had opted for a plan inclusive of breakfast and dinner.  This is a really good option to select. 

We will surely recommend staying at the Batra Hotel and enjoying their hospitality to everyone who is planning a trip to Kashmir.

"BATRA, The B est Accomodation for TRAvellers","5","2023-03","2023-03-16","I am from Hyderabad and visited Srinagar previous week with my family and stayed for 4 days at The Batra Hotel Srinagar. Prior to the visit, I interacted with Mr Saqib, Assistant Reservations Manager at the Hotel though Phone, Whatsapp and Email for assistance regarding Accommodation at BATRA hotel. I was extremely happy with the communication with him. He was very soft-spoken, gentle and quite informative. He has given excellent guidance on various tourist places in and around Srinagar and Climate there-in. 

Upon arrival in the hotel, we were given a warm welcome by the staff, with the special Kashmiri Kahwa. The room was very comfortable, spacious with excellent ambiance and a grand view of the Snow mountains through the Window. The breakfast and Dinner at the Pure Vegetarian Niramish Restaurent were quite delicious with lots of varieties, particularly to meet the taste of tourists from South. The food provided at the hotel was as memorable as the beautiful places of Kashmir.  I am thankful to each member of the hotel, for the  hospitality shown by the staff of the desk, house keeping Mr Nadeem and the restaurant, Mr Vasim, to name a few. I Wish the Hotel Management all the very best and I also wish they establish their branches at various places of J & K for the need of Vegetarian tourists.

The food was good, rooms were clean, staff was polite and even took care of me when i fell sick.

The hotel GM is very generous and was willing to go an extra mile to make sure I felt comfortable and was taken care of. The price is a bit on the higher side but worth every penny.

A must stay place for anyone traveling with family atleast. The hotel is close to market and places are easily accessible.

I thank everyone at Batra Hotel to make my not-so-great kashmir trip yet memorable.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r881986034-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452389098","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abhij1709","Abhishek","69414F07A780BBB57349F188C59526F2",,,,,"abhij1709",,"General Manager","882146613","en","2023-03-14","Jaydeep Bhat","Dear Guest,

"3 Night stay experience in Batra hotel","5","2023-02","2023-02-25","Batra hotel provides the finest service in Srinagar. I stayed with my family for 3 nights, the comfort of the family suite was remarkable. They have provided the well furnished, spacious, and well equipped room for a family of 4. The washroom was well maintained and in hygienic condition. Additionally, the staff was very supportive; especially Mr. Ashish ( manager of the hotel) is the very polite and friendly person. The best part of the hotel is the near to the main market, everything is available on walking distance itself. Not to forget the in-house restaurant of the Batra hotel, this is the only hotel in the Srinagar which served only vegetarian food. So if you are looking for a purely vegitarian hotel in Srinagar. The Batra hotel is the best. The served food was also very delicious, they provide the authentic veg kashmiri food. The restraunt staff was very good, especially Wasim bhai was very sweet. One must try out batra hotel; if they are planning to visit Srinagar.

Hotel staff were friendly in nature from GM to bell boys. Checkin was a breeze, Ms. Nida and Mr. Peerzada at frontdesk were never short of anything we asked for. Since our most of the time was spent in lobby, bell boys specially Tawseef kept on assisting us with our tasks.
The Door man relentlessly kept opening door for us as I along with my colleagues moved in/out several times in a day, always with a smile and no complaints for 4 days of our stay. 
Food was equally good, with VFM buffet spread. Mr. Vishnu at tea/golgappa counter was fascinating. During breakfast, Chef at Live kitchen served delicious butter masala dosa and best coconut chatni. 
On occasions GM interacted personally to learn about any shortcomings, which were none for our stay. Last but not the least FnB Team Ishfaq Bhat, Shahid, Sajad,Aabid, Najeeb,Majid,Aijaz all of them were fabulous.

"No way near 4*","3","2015-06","2015-08-18","We stayed here for 2 nights.  We had 2 rooms.  The problems started as soon as we checked in.  The room allotted to us was filled with cigarette smoke and the toilets were stinking.  We immediately complained to the hotel staff.  Surprisingly, they just brushed aside our comment.  We left in a while and returned at night.  To our shock, the room still smelt the same and the toilet was in the same condition as we left.  We had to make noise, which we did.  The staff offered us another room with a big but........ The room cannot be locked from outside and we had to leave the door ajar whenever we had to go out. The staff informed us that the locksmith would arrive only the next day morning at 10 and the lock would be fixed. We were very happy that we could at least lock it from inside.

 Do you expect this from a 4 star hotel.  The Hotel charged me a bomb and they have no regrets that they put us through this.  The manager never bothered to visit us and offer his apologies.  The Wifi is so weak that if your rooms are inside, you will get no wifi.  Overall, we felt cheated by this star rating and the service offered by the staff.  We surely do not appreciate the hotel charging us so much for such a poor quality service.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r300620388-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","6","33","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GOPALANS_12","GOPALAN S","CED49AEE45443649331A58874DC6E910",,,,,"GOPALANS_12",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

"Kashmir Visit via Cox N Kings June 2015","2","2015-06","2015-06-09","We have just finished visiting Kashmir and stayed here for a total of two nights . We had two rooms. At the first place there were no toiletries available though provided to us later with the excuse that the rooms have been just vacated. There are absolutley no charging points in the rooms which is must nowdays given the fact that we carry multiple electrical equipments. The rooms from 110 to 127 onwaards are located at the back side and every night there is huge noise from outside of the kitchen staff . Secondly there was a peculair odour in the rooms , I feel mainly because of the kitchen being cleaned every night and the food being disposed off . The first night there was no electricity for around 4 hours . In the washroom of our room the commode was loose and the even the washbasin was loose and water used to leak outside . The curtains were too heavy to move them aside . 
The good part was that the staff was very helpful and attentive . Though I personally felt that the Manager was a bit too curt at times . The food was also good and well served , however the tables were always dirty as the hotel used table cloths and they are not changed frequently. 
However , the staff are very nice and helped me and my family.

Most of the rooms are compact. However, the heating system in the rooms is superb.

Thank you for sparing your valuable time and posting your review of Jamal Resorts, Srinagar on Trip Advisor from your stay with us!

We are disappointed to note that you were dissatisfied with your stay with us. Allow us to clarify the shortcomings. Our Check-in Time is 12 Noon. Your arrival at the hotel was at 830am. Early check-ins are not allowed unless notified in advance since we need to prepare the rooms for the guests. Since the hotel was running full, rooms were not available and your check-in got delayed as we didn't have prior information of your early-check-in. You were provided a temporary room which was not ready since you insisted on checking-in and starting your Tour. This room didn't have the usual Toiletries and since it was not ready for Check-in. You were shifted to your original Super Deluxe Room booking once you came back from your Day Tour of Srinagar the same evening. The usual amenities were present in the Super Deluxe Room including Toiletries. 

We have 8 Super Deluxe Rooms at the resort which are identical and exactly as per the images provided on our website and other Online Travel Portals. Im glad you have appreciated our Room Heating.

We would appreciate further comments & feedback on where we can further raise the bar, if you could email me at info@jamalresorts.com. Your feedback is valuable to us and helps us in our endeavor of constant improvement. I once again thank you for it.

"A must stay !!!","5","2014-12","2015-01-16","A 7 nights stay in the mid of December, and we are still amused with the essence of our stay at Jamal Resort. Excellent location, heart throbbing habitat and cozy rooms, the restaurant at the resort serves the best food we came across during our stay, quality of products at JCI Complex is marvelous and are ample in variety in comparison to other stores at the city (actually we minimized our shopping at JCI as we were already over baggage, feeling numbed), and the welcoming and friendly staff there are milestones in the field hospitality and tourism. 

Staff across whole JCI Complex and Resort provide their best possible support and suggestion as and when required, always ready to help and they seriously did, excellent room service, speedy service at restaurant and their dedication, sincerity and fun loving nature makes the atmosphere very delightful. 

Cab service provided by the resort, as we were traveling on the daily basis to the various locations in the city and nearby, was also extremely good and the drivers & the guides were polite and humble. 

We are planning our next trip, a much sooner, back to the ""paradise on earth"" and the stay would be, undoubtedly, JAMAL RESORT.

The rooms are basic but clean, with an amazing view of Dal Lake, especially at night. Their central heating system is AMAZING and very much needed in Srinagar as it gets really cold at night. You feel cozy once inside the room/hotel.

I would like to thank Mr. Imtiyaz (Front Desk Executive) for his amazing hospitality and assistance during our trip! He is reliable, knowledgeable, gave good suggestions, and helped us with the bookings. Truly appreciate his guidance and support during our stay in Srinagar. Please connect with Mr. Imtiyaz if you need any assistance with your Kashmir trip.

Next comes the amazing kitchen staff. Everyone at the restaurant was warm, courteous, and welcoming. We were greeted and catered to by Mr. Irshad Mir along with his colleagues Imtiyaz Sheikh, Arif, Zahid, and Zakir.

All in all, we had a good and comfortable stay, and we will definitely stay again!

"Paradise of srinagar","5","2014-09","2014-10-27","We were on a honeymoon trip to J&K and with utmost fortune checked in jamal resorts, Srinagar.
If Jammu & Kashmir is said to be the paradise of India, trust me Jamal resort is the paradise of srinagar.
Anyone should learn how every hotel should be and how to treat their customers.

Unfortunately we got stuck in J&K floods as we checked in on 5th of September nad coul;d not make it to the airport due to flood devastation.
It was the people in jamal who made us not to realise that we are fllod victims rather they ensured we enjoyed our stay in those tuff times also.
If it was not jamal resort i dont think we would have made it alive back home.
Everybody right from the MD of the hotel their family members, the manager of the resort Mr.Bilal and everystaff of the hotel were extremely helpful, kind , courteous and passionate about customers and customer service.
I am working in a senoir position in a service industry and i have a very high standards of service expectations and beleive me, jamal has far exceeded the expectations.
About the quality of the hotel, its neat claen and tidy, all the time and the facilities are amazing.

In short its  home away from home, u ask and u will get it be it any thing and the food at the hotel is amazing.

for me next time a plan to J&K, it would obviously be jamal resorts with out any second thoughts.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r236656521-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452387929","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","1200","5","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravikanth33","Ravikanth Jayar...

"Humbled by their service!","5","2014-09","2014-10-20","We stayed at the Jamal Resort for almost 2 weeks and absolutely loved it. This hotel is a perfect place to relax and not far enough from the Main Street of traffic so you have a peaceful atmosphere. The staff at the reception was very welcoming (specially the manager Mr. Bilal) and very helpful. Rooms are spacious, whole hotel is impeccably clean, and the staff are lovely and willing to help with any queries you may have. 

A great place with the most pleasing staff and owners I have ever seen. Great food, Great value for money. They did everything possible to make our stay as comfortable as possible. 

At the time of floods all the staff and owner of the hotel helped us a lot and provided home like feeling at hotel.

For the price we paid, we felt it had totally exceeded our expectations. Will definitely stay there again when we visit Srinagar next.

Once again ,me and my wife would like to thank Mr.Bilal and your staff for making our stay so enjoyable during our visit to Srinagar.

Highly recommend this hotel!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r235336417-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452391125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg","1200","3","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aiyazr","Aiyaz R","13051BE17D075EFEC4C9DA7809DBA94D",,,,,"aiyazr",,"General Manager","256347135","en","2015-02-25","GMJamalResorts","Dear Aiyaz:

"Big Name, Bakwas Service","1","2014-02","2014-09-10","During our stay in Kashmir for 10 days, we stayed for 3 nights in Jamal Resorts. Though its building gives a feeling of luxury, it is very ordinary inside. My booking was done through Make My Trip in a luxury package. But I was given a room balcony of which was packed by a 6ft wall, so you can't have any look outside the room. The toilet was not even cleaned before allotment of room. On my strong objection they changed my room. Later I found that the Bed Sunmica was torned in the side which was dengerous for my kid. I complained but nobody took care and pasted the same.
In restaurant, buffet food arrangement was very poor. Thry dont serve variety of food in buffet. Very limited food option. With maximum one desert. They use very ordinary  cutlery in restaurant and for eating desert they will provide a 25 paise white plastic spoon which you generally see in a roadside snacks shop. Servicing in restaurant was so poor that you have to help yourself for all service including water and water jug, as waiter are busy in gossiping and watching TV.
Overall, it was total wastage of money against provided infrastructure and service if you are staying in Jamal Resorts, Srinagar.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r228070021-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452390706","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1200","12","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ppranava9","Pranava S","DBEACD012B6E663A621F1211348CE132",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","ppranava9",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

"Pathetic Food and Services","2","2014-09","2014-09-04","Apart from the location, nothing was good about the hotel. The resort is located near Nishat Bagh and that's the only good thing about it. We stayed in the hotel for 2 days - breakfast and dinner were included with the stay. Food quality was pathetic; be it for breakfast or for dinner. Rooms were comfortable but gloomy with very dim lights. Room service was also not good and waiters were quite rude - we asked for a cup of tea around 7.30 in the evening as I was not feeling well and the waiter replied ""sir abhi dinner time hai; chai aapko 10 baje milegi (sir, its dinner time, you well get tea at 10)"". It was raining the second day and we asked for an umbrella from the manager; a hotel staff person came up with a broken umbrella - this is not a service that you expect from a hotel like Jamal Resort.

"Good location, but nothing else","3","2014-07","2014-08-09","The best thing I can say about Jamal is that it is situated at walking distance (little more than a kilometre)  Dal Lake and Nishat Bagh. That's it. The staff is affable and helpful and the service is okay, but for their prices I would expect much better. Specifically, the rooms are clean but gloomy. It says something when a lazy person like me didn't want to spend a minute extra in the room. The furnishings are dark, the curtains were brown, there was wood (well, sunmica) EVERYWHERE including a wooden ceiling. Ugh. Can anyone say ""claustrophobia""? The food was quite crap too. Sadly enough, there are no restaurants close by so we ended up eating at the hotel out of necessity. If we hadn't paid the entire amount well in advance, we would have found someplace better. 
In such a well-touristed place, there are tons of other options.  I'd say pick something else.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r220702421-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452389795","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","1200","12","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellsonmyfingers","bellsonmyfingers","BE7DFA86187A541EB8BE6533067C5A29",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","bellsonmyfingers",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"
"choose the right","4","2014-06","2014-07-13","On our way back from LEH, we wanted to stop over at SRINAGAR and check out a few things. Most of the others we found were either too expensive or not up to our liking. Found this place online, took a chance and it turned out to be very good. Except the view of the surroundings from the room we have nothing to complain. 
40 mins to Airport, very well maintained service apt type of rooms,  free wi-fi, free BF and excellent service from staff. Location is pretty close to MUGHAL GARDENS and we did cover NISHAT GARDEN,CHESMA SHI,PARI MAHAL,DAL LAKE etc. All travel arrangements were taken care of by the hotel General manager Mr Feroz,. Food is served in the living room  on request  and was good as well. The best hotel in terms of service & food, peaceful location, wonderful service, the service was more like man to man. and we had a great stay with wonderful hospitality the hotel offered.

"Best in the category","4","2014-06","2014-07-02","From Anil Arora. Firstly, Thanks to the manager Mr. Bilal - Courteous, friendly, approachable and resolves all your problems with a smile !!! Bilal ji, thank you and keep it up !!! and the upgrade to super deluxe room was even better. I think you are holding the fort for Jamal resorts. About the hotel, it is situated in a quite place which is pollution free and about 5 kms from dal lake with excellent mountain view. Folks let me tell you, staying in hotels near Dal Lake has it's cons like traffic, pollution..yes, there is pollution in Srinagar too :-( another important point to note is that most of the hotels near Dal Lake are decades old and not every place is livable. I would recommend Jamal resorts to every peace loving person. Can't expect any hotel better than Jamal Resorts in this category!! though Non Vegetarians may not be happy with the options here..don't try and compare it with 5 stars and hotels in big cities","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r213274701-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","15","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnilAr0ra","AnilAr0ra","B87F6B331F306AA316AE8ED9E89C6D72",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","AnilAr0ra",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

The morphed Picture of Jamal on the website is a way to allure tourist to pay (astronomical rates) and stay in the property. Go with NO expectation. Stayed for 3 nights this June 2014 with family and had a terrible experience. Like ‘Dharmasala’ doors will be knocked at 7 am even as tea/ coffee makers are provided in the rooms. The plug points do not work and for  hot water you have to inform reception every time and then through some funny system it is supplied. At times that also did not work while we were there. Food is okiesh. Trip Advisor should be more careful and check the pictures that are being provided for posting.

I stayed on 4 n 5 may 2014

1)Very helpful ppl...
2)Awesome property...
3)Though far from city byt its ok as everyone has car or vehicle when they come.
4)Dinner n breakfast are hot n good lot of variety and on demand give jain food too.
5) Visit jamal carpets shop n industries they have awesome variety. ..They give u 30 percent discount for hotel guests plus ur capacity to bargin...There was young lad whose name I am not able to recalll but very good salesman..I took blanket which was too soft n nice plus shawl n stoles bargain n u get right prices. ..

"A city type compact hotel in a far away location","3","2014-02","2014-03-08","We stayed in this property from 26 Feb. 2014 to 1st march (3Nights)
And again for 1 Night on 2nd march to 3rd march.
It is Located about 10-11 kms from the city. When your choose a hotel at a distance and that too a resort you expect a big property with some facilities not just rooms. But it is just a city type hotel property. It definitely is not a Resort. It is situated in the complex of Jamal Carpet Ind.     I.E JCI ( a joint venture of JCI ) WHICH IS A  two storied show room , has a parking area and a lawn in front of the showroom. Pictures are misleading. Whatever you see in picture taken from the gate of the complex is the show room and parking of Jamal Carpet Ind. The hotel is on the left side of showroom not at all visible in the picture. The same I have marked in the pictures.
 It has two rows of rooms along the depth of whole plot with a 4’ to 5’ wide corridor in between.  All the rooms on ground floor are Double DX Rooms (26). They are small sized approx 12’* 10’ with a Bath area of approx 6’*5’.  There are 4 super Dx rooms on 1st floor and 4 on 2nd floor which are bigger and better.  In all the hotel looks like an annexes in a big bungalow.
In one row of rooms i.e. 13 room –the window faces the parking area of showroom.  You can never put the curtain aside. Windows in the other row of rooms face a blank boundary wall about 3 to 4 feet away.  In a way all the rooms are closed boxes. Electric blankets and room heater were provided. Central heating is also available but is put on only from 7:30 p.m to 11:30 pm. 
No room has a view or sunshine at any time of day.
Staff: Reception executives Mr. Latif, Mr. Billal are nice, helpful. Other staff members are also helpful.

 Restaurant is at the far end of rows of rooms. It is not centrally heated. Only one gas heater in all with a sitting capacity of 50 to 60. So you feel chilly inside the restaurant as Srinagar is a very cold place for most part of the year.
Staff is good but deficient is service in etiquette.
Breakfast was included in our tariff. Whatever they serve has to be taken and choices are limited. They did provide me omlette on request. But on all four days request for Parantha was declined. Every day they said “it is not in menu to-day” Moreover everything becomes cold very soon. 
 We had to face a v sad experience for dinner. 
On the first night we found Buffet dinner was laid out, with limited veg options. Price Rs 450 per pax. As per the quality and ambience the price is at a higher side. Moreover we usually prefer ala cart dinner as we eat v less at dinner. That way one has more choice rather than a fixed menu.
I told them so.
 Answer was: “Sir even if you choose ala cart we can serve only from the items already prepared for Buffet. We will make a potion from the same and serve you. You can’t choose anything else from the menu”.
It was really a first time experience for me. Then the Restaurant’s executive himself said that for two of you as a concession we will be charging for one. 
I told them that for that we will have to share from one plate and just to pay less I don’t want to do that.
He further said that we can use two plates. 
After dinner we asked for the bill so that we sign it In order to avoid any misunderstanding at time of check out. They agreed but reluctantly.
2nd Night:  they said the bill will be sent to the reception only. I felt something was odd and insisted on seeing and signing the bill. After some arguments they told that now they will charge for two and not one as promised the 1st night. On my insistence and reminding them their own offer and commitment, they prepared the bill for Rs 450/- and got it signed.
3rd Night: as we picked up the plates and were just going to put something in the plate a man jumped towards us and told “AAP AISE NAHI LE SAKTE.  APKO DO KE CHARGES LAGENGE.” These were the actual words.
 We were speechless, didn’t know how to react. I didn’t know what to say as there were other guests around. Feeling cheated and helpless we put the plates back and rushed to our room without uttering a word.  We felt very humiliated.
After some time my wife ordered dinner from the room as we had not eaten anything during the daytime.
Next morning our checkout day we went for breakfast no one was making an eye contact with us. Every one realized they had made a big mistake with their guests. But No one said sorry for the last night not at least orally.
Summarizing: if you take out the showroom etc it is an ordinary city type hotel located at least 10 kms from main city area. All double Dx rooms are compact type. There is one almirah in the room but it has no partitions. It can be used only for hangers.  Very small dressing table (about 9’’* 40 “) in front of the mirror. But no drawer in it. You cannot unpack your luggage.  No room has a view. Bath room is also not big. No ambience. Though superior db Dx rooms are bigger and better.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r196621804-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1024","194157990","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/92/9d/a6/ashok-g.jpg","1024","55","404","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrAshokGupta_Ldh","DrAshokGupta","EF182342186FFAD667AF70CE1B6B71D8",,"297664","Ludhiana, India","Ludhiana","DrAshokGupta_Ldh",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

"Memorable Stay","4","2013-10","2013-12-26","First visit to Srinagar ….We had a marvellous stay in Srinagar at Jamal Resorts. The best part of the resort is the location… It is also very close to everything…. near to Mughal Gardens & Dal Lake. Beside this the resort is a beauty in itself be it a traditional wonderful interiors, very good service and some excellent dining too, must recommend the hotel's Restaurant for the traditional cuisine and some exquisite non veg dishes.  Hospitality and housekeeping personnel were very helpful and dedicated. Especially the cleanness of the rooms and hotel facilities impressed me. The reception people were nice and hospitable and helped us out in all possible way be it any fault during the stay or arranging vehicles for commuting.  My only qualm was that the restaurant closed a little too early each evening.

Linen especially towels were not very clean. Food was above average and the service was ok type as the staff was untrained and very aggressive. The only good thing about this hotel was that it was very close to the Mughal gardens. Restaurant again needs to be kept clean as you cannot sit inside and have your meal due to a foul smell.

The floor was very dirty and sticky and the place was stinking. We decided to sit outside due to foul smell. Next day we had to visit Sonamarg but to our surprise there was no hot water in the bathroom. After several complaints and waiting for 2 hours, we left without taking bath. Even the next morning there was no hot water an after repeated complaints we got moderately warm water after 2 hours. So we finally decided to check out after 2 nights only and move to another hotel for the 3rd night. The hotel I think has nice rooms but it is not professionally managed. The staff and the management has a very casual attitude, gives you a feeling you are staying in a guest house and not a resort.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r184651492-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"197","74616096","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/72/8d/20/gautamjain13.jpg","320","5","29","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gautamjain13","Gautam Jain","B535C36279055FE9204C5448941B9EEB",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","gautamjain13",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"
"Compact rooms but comfortable and clean overall","4","2013-10","2013-10-22","We stayed three nights in October 2013. Location is a bit far from Dal Gate area but there's plenty shopping areas around the Nishat area. Rooms are a bit compact; perfect for a couple but not sure how they would fit in an extra bed. Perhaps they have larger rooms for 3 beds but do check in advance. Plenty of electrical points (rare in hotels these days). Zero fuss hot water around the clock. The hotel is not too large and is actually a part of a carpet showroom complex owned by the same people. Free wi-fi in lobby and if you're lucky, in the rooms closer to the lobby. Lovely garden with flowers. No amenities like in-room coffee/tea. Large LCD with DTH. Staff was friendly and helpful.

"Nice Child-friendly resort.","5","2013-08","2013-10-10","We were a group of NRIs from Montreal Canada booked at this resort in Srinagar. The resort is located in Srinagar near the Dal Lake and provides good quality rooms and a great ambience. Since we were travelling with as many as 7 children, we found the games and kids’ facilities at Jamal really useful and our kids were pre-occupied all the time. The resort itself is quite large and there is always something to do in case you are spending a day there. However we did find ourselves sightseeing for most of the days we were there. The rooms are new and well designed. We were staying in the Super-Deluxe Rooms which are at par with the hotels in Montreal. The bedding quality was very good, the flat panel TV has premium cable channels and that too in HD. Bathrooms were well done as well with a nice cute tub. They have a nice restaurant which has indoor as well as outdoor seating. We had ordered a barbecue for all 15 of us and had a great time in the evening time. The service is attentive and waiters are eager. We found that the restaurant would get very crowded at 9 pm and hence we used to go earlier at around 7:45 pm to avoid the rush. Food quality was good a bit spicy for our liking. Desserts were amazing especially the Indian ones. Recommended for Families with kids.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r180520863-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"768","65444027","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/e6/98/bb/canuck-trader.jpg","1024","2","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canuck_trader","Canuck_trader","7390979C198272BAFD7B098F7313376A",,,,,"Canuck_trader",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

"Amazing Experience","5","2024-08","2024-08-14","My mother and her sister recently stayed at Welcome Hotel in Srinagar, and they had a wonderful experience. The hotel is beautifully situated with stunning views of the Dal Lake, which they absolutely loved.

He made sure their stay was comfortable and enjoyable, always going the extra mile to assist them with anything they needed. Imtiyaz's hospitality made them feel right at home, and they appreciated his helpful recommendations on what to see and do in Srinagar.

The hotel itself was clean and comfortable, with well-appointed rooms that offered everything they needed for a relaxing stay. They also enjoyed the delicious food served at the hotel's restaurant, which had a good mix of local and international dishes.

The food was excellent, and the breakfast offered a good variety of options. The restaurant staff were also very attentive.

A few aspects could have been improved. For instance, we had to request additional tea mugs to accommodate the number of people in our room, as the housekeeping staff only provided the standard two mugs, even though we had booked a family suite. Additionally, one of the bathrooms lacked hand soap, so we had to ask for it. However, the staff responded to our requests promptly.

"Great Experience","4","2013-06","2013-09-18","I stayed in this hotel in June with my wife and kid and had a great experience. Although little late in posting the review but I wanted to appreciate the room service and restuarant staff and the front desk for the great service. Out stay was good and we enjoyed. The place is quite and calm from the city noise so we had enjoyed, rooms were cleans and spacious for a family of 3. Some recommendation - Should have some more play options for kids (below 10) and also a shuttle service to mughal garden (outside ~2kms), just outside the main road. Also should have a strong internet connection to rooms. We had to come to lobby for a good connection.

Double delux rooms are in the ground floor  which we found to be little crammed up and ordinary. We shifted to super delux rooms on the first floor on the third day and that made all the difference. These rooms are large and classy with spacious toilets. Though the water heating system was little complicated, but we somehow managed.

Thank you for sparing your time and posting your review of our hotel on Trip Advisor.

We understand your disappointment regarding your son's birthday. We would like to clarify that the hotel was not informed by Makemytrip.com about organising any party as such. As a special gesture, we did organise a cake and setup in our garden so that you could enjoy your birthday. We did not bill you or MMT for this service. We understand that you did not like the flavour of the cake, but due to lack of time we could only organise a Chocolate flavour. We apologise for the same and at the same time request you to take up the issue with MMT, as the birthday party was not part of your stay. 

We trust that you will not hold this experience against us. We urge you to visit Jamal Resorts once again. I will personally look into your next stay. We would appreciate more specific comments & feedback on where we can further raise the bar, if you could email me at info@jamalresorts.com

"Good Service & hospitality, but overpriced and average food","3","2013-05","2013-05-19","We stayed for two days and two nights. It has huge open space at entrance gate with beautiful garden and lawn. The reception place is good and huge. The hotel entrance is good. We were allotted Room Nos.202, 203 & 204 which were on first floor above kitchen. The lobby was covered by 6 ft tall opaque glass. Nothing could be seen therefrom. The windows in all rooms open to backside of some residence. Nothing pleasant. Rooms were not that efficiently cleaned.  The AC unit in 204 gets automatically started and even shut off. We have to bear kitchen sound until midnight and early in morning. But the room service was good. The staff at Tulip restaurant was good. They served us with warm breakfast. It seems that they are mainly in business of selling carpets, shawls etc. and resort is side business.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r161162343-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452390812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg","1200","3","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunilAgnihotri","SunilAgnihotri","BD9133A02795E1D6EAEF4467BB7DB11A",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","SunilAgnihotri",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

"Not a resort by any standard, wastage of money","1","2012-06","2013-04-17","You surely have heard about ""a potent Indian herbal laxative. The so called resort is no different. We , a group of four stayed at this Godforsaken place on 21st June, 2012.

Why:
1. It is not worth Rs. 6,000/- per night. Very expensive, not worth it.
2. It is more than 9 kms from Dal Lake, located on a small road. You will waste money to commute.
3. The rooms are very small. Your kids won't enjoy either within or outside the rooms.
4. The TV is just 4 feet away from the bed.
5. Hospitality industry stresses a lot on courtesy. It is the most important part. But, at Jamal Resort this is alien concept. Warning: You might feel insulted or unwanted, because they know that you won't purchase anything from there shop which is within the compound.
6. The rooms don't have an AC or a Fridge, you will need it in summer months as the temperature is similar to Delhi.
7. Please don't be mis-led by the pictures or description on the web-site. You will not find it among trees or mountains. 3-acre property (as claimed) is incorrect.
8. They refused dinner even within the stipulated restaurant timings.
9. Your perception of a ""Resort"" will be hit hard here.

Before booking I called up the resort, the person named Feroz asked me not to book via the web-site, as it will be expensive & he gave me a lower rate which included breakfast. But we did not get breakfast & we didn't argue as we were getting late. So be careful, you will not get what you actually pay for.

On our arrival, the guard guided our (self-driven) vehicle to the front of the reception (to take our luggage out). Feroz conceitedly asked us to remove the car.

They refused dinner 20 minutes before closing time. After haggling, they sent cold food to the room.

Its not Kashmir, it is ""Cash More"" ""as they consider Indian"" travellers.

"POOR ACCOMODATION","3","2013-02","2013-03-29","We, two sr,ctzn, booked this acco through Cox & Kings, by default as our choice was Grand Mumtaz ( now under renovation). We had to stay there on 20.03.13 and from 24.03.13 to 27.03.13. We specifically asked for twin sharing room with two seperate beds in a room. When we reached there find that the room appointed for us is a double bedroom. On insisting seperate two beds in the room they seperated the double bed in a 12'x10' room without having any wardrobe, luggage racks and any comfortable chairs/ centre table. We could not even open our suitcaes properly. Attached toilet is of 6'x5' size very cramped. We told them to provide a decent deluxe room which they agreed to provide during our return stay from 24.03.13 for three days. But this time also they could not provide the room  asked for (rm. no. 126) inspite of their earlier agreement. Instead they provided two seperate rooms on the rear side which are equally bad without any furnitures and with very old uncomfortable bed mattresses ( Rm. No. H4 & H5 and without any wardrobe/chair/table). It is found that this hotel do not have any arrangements for twin sharing rooms. All rooms are meant for couple staying in double bed.
Jamal resort is owned by owner of Jamal Carpet Industries (JCI) and the website picture shows their showroom which is in focus and not actual hotel which is, perhaps, developed as alternative bussiness in the same campus.
Hotel is located in a poor neighbourhood and 1.5 kms away from Dal Lake shore road having no good view in and around, but the front side entrance to property is kept clean with a small garden.
Services are okay. Behavior of staff are also satisfactory. Food is okay but no variety.

"NO STANDARD","1","2022-05","2022-06-12","Horrendous for the following reasons: 
1. Rooms - The layout of the room so is very weird, sheets were not clean, the sofa was also weird and peeling. Very odd bathroom as well, the showering area and toilet area is not split so the whole toilet gets wet when you try to shower. There’s a rainfall shower but the regular hand shower does not work so you’re expected to shower with a pail. The toilet bowl itself does not flush properly. The rooms and cleanliness was just not up to the mark and not worth the money at all, especially during peak season. 

2. Breakfast - The breakfast food is not nice and there’s very little options. The worst part is the dirty tables. The staff does not clean up after guests and you’re expected to sit and eat amongst crumbs and spillage. Even if you ask the staff to clean the table, they do a terrible job and there’s leftover food on all tables. 

3. Staff - They’re okay, could be friendly and more approachable, especially the restaurant staff. Room service takes quite a while to attend to your needs as well. 

I would not recommend this hotel unless you’re really desperate for somewhere to sleep at night. Although the location of the hotel is good, it does not provide the comfort of a hotel after a tiring day of siteseeing. We dreaded coming back to the hotel. I wish I had taken pictures but I really disliked this place to the point of not wanting to take any pictures of it.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r842553804-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452392029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","4","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harpreettttttt","Harpreet","1A10236F649A4EF89B3DF82D6D657687",,"294262","Singapore","Singapore","harpreettttttt",,"General Manager","842644624","en","2022-06-13","Jaydeep Bhat","Dear guest

"Great location and excellent customer delight","5","2022-05","2022-06-07","Well words will be insufficient to explain to service and experience Batra Hotel creates for their customer. I visited this May for 4 nights with my family and rooms were out of my expectation for price they have charged. Room was so big and beautiful that made my family happy. Hotel is pure veg, if you are vegetarian you will like, also there are many pure veg restaurant and dhaba in front of the hotel which serve great food. So location wise it is good and Dal Lake is just less than 1 km. Staff is very good and polite and always ready to help. I would like to mention about Mr. Parvinder(Prince) and Munir for their great service and customer delight. Mr. Parvinder were quite helpful during the stay and even after the stay he helped me in dispatching my camera charger which I left at the hotel room.

"Batra ---Dishonest Staff, Below Average Hotel","1","2022-03","2022-03-14","This is one of the most hyped and overrated Hotels of Valley. The front desk staff is rotten to the core, dishonest and displays highest levels of sycophancy. 

I had the most horrible experience of being not alloted the rooms despite having confirmed booking on Goibibo. After asking them repeatedly,  they smile to their teeth and gave a vicious smile and said "" SORRY SIR, OUR ENTIRE FLOOR HAS GONE SHORT CIRCUIT. As you are our old regular customers we ll fetch you rooms in other properties(which they didn't try a zilch)"" . To my wildest surprise hotel was full and a couple who came after us was awarded with room stay..

I would like to warn other travelers that they must reconsider their decision to stay in this hotel equipped with Janus faced double standards staff and definitely below average rooms.

This comes from an old time customer of them

"Pricey but very good option in front of Ghat 7","4","2024-05","2024-05-29","Hotel is a old property(1986) but very very well maintained. 
I got a newly renovated upgraded business suite.
Mr Imtiyaz at reception was cordial. 
He Pointed out one of my error in booking (2 kids of different ages were erroneously booked as same age. I had to pay 1600/- per day extra for same) 
Overall room was big and I think freshly renovated and lake facing. 
Bathrooms were pristine clean with bathtub. Kids enjoyed.

Only thing if u get 104 room suite try to get the room in 2nd floor as the view of Dal is completely obstructed by the hotel name board.
Hotel is opposite to Ghat 7 so very easy to take Shikara ride from the Ghat. I took shikara ride at 7am with no tourists in Dal hence a serene experience.
Food taste was great both both ala- carte as well as breakfast spread. Breakfast buffet has above average options.
It was peak of tourism hence didn't get to interact with anyone from hotel but overall excellent stay. Will recommend it.
Pricey at almost 24k for a family of 4 with 2 adults and 2 kids aged 5&10.

Thank you for sparing your time and posting your review of our hotel on Trip Advisor.

With reference to your review we are unable to find your stay details with us. Meanwhile would you please let us know your check in check out dates, room number & your booking details to enable us to investigate the matter as off-hand your review seems to be generalised, biased & influenced. You haven't indicated your room type, which restaurant at the property you ate in etc, no specific details. You have made sweeping remarks against our hotel in each and every category. As a responsible and genuine hotelier, we would like to investigate your stay to ascertain such sweeping resentment. Kindly provide us your stay details on info@jamalresorts.com and rest assured your stay will looked into and the issue brought to a logical conclusion. At present, as per our records we dont have any record of your stay with us.

A few clarifications for the reader. We serve Bed Tea in the room itself and not in the restaurant. In the higher category rooms, there is a Tea/Coffer Maker. We have the most modern German Made Centralised Heating System installed at the resort. Jamal Resorts is located between on the main Nishat-Shalimar Road. Adjoining are 3 markets of Nishat, Shalimar and Ishber. Within 1 km either way, there are at least 15 restaurants, 8 Hotels, and at least 35 Handicraft shops, 1 Large format Supermarket called Nova, and 2 Shikara ghats on the Dal Lake. 

We would appreciate more specific comments & feedback on where we can further raise the bar, if you could email me at info@jamalresorts.com

Your feedback is valuable to us and helps us in our endeavor of constant improvement. I once again thank you for it.

"Pleasant and memorable stay ..","5","2012-11","2013-01-04","I stayed with my family in the later part of November 2012 at Jamal Resorts. Coming from Australia, frankly we were concerned about quality of service but it turned out to be extremely good experience for all of us. The cleanliness (room and any other part of hotel), service, food and usual courtesies extended from time to time was admirable. Everything went just perfect. Little details were taken care of as part of the daily routine that obviously helps in adding value. Let me be clear that when you don't have to run after minor items like heater not working, water not coming, etc. then stay becomes enjoyable and that is exactly I meant to say about Jamal Resorts. The Managers at reception or dining section were very kind and attentive to their respective services. 
What more can one expect? Good value for money. Thank you.

The staff when  they were working were not helpful in booking any tours and could not even recommend someone I could try.The hotel is far outside the city so it is expensive to go anywhere. The biggest problem  we experienced was the hotel staff was not on duty from 12-7:30am. So, when our heater stopped working at night there was nobody we could contact. It was extremely cold here this time year. Breakfast was  included and it was 1 1/2 hours late so we had to wait while they scrambled to put something together and we had to start the day later than planned.

Thank you for sparing your time and posting your review of our hotel on Trip Advisor from your stay with us in January 2013.

We are disappointed to note that your were not satisfied with your stay. Allow me to clarify the management's position on your stay.

You were indeed booked for 2 nights at our resort through an online travel company. You did not check-in on the first day as per your booking. You arrived on the second day of your stay and demanded a refund of your first night's stay. This is not possible as per the hotel's contract with the travel company. Your hotel voucher clearly states as under:

""failure of the guest to check-in will be treated as No-Show and will be chargeable with 100% retention""

Under these circumstances it is not possible to refund you a 1 night charge. This has been intimated to you during your stay and in our email exchanges as well. We hope this again clarifies our stand on the refund.

We trust that you will not hold this experience against the hotel and its services.

We look forward to your next visit to Srinagar. Kindly email me your next travel plan on info@jamalresorts.com and I will personally look into your booking. We would appreciate more specific comments & feedback on where we can further raise the bar, if you could email me at info@jamalresorts.com

Your feedback is valuable to us and helps us in our endeavor of constant improvement. I once again thank you for it.

"Pleasant & Decent Stay","4","2012-07","2013-01-01","Went with a group of friends for our expedition trip to Leh and stayed there for a night. Check in and check out was good. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. I kept my expectations low as we did a customized package trip , but i was surprised with their service as well. Food was served in their restaurant which was the only sour point especially the ambieance but the food was decent enough for dinner and breakfast. Location is also good as its close to the lake and gardens. The biggest dissapointment was the internet access as it was restricted only to the lobby. They had a cute shopping space though just within the hotel premisis which was expectedly costly. 

Would suggest this place for couples though especially if they are on expedition trips.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r148568355-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1280","246591530","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/b2/b0/2a/varun-v.jpg","960","55","260","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VarunV766","Varun V","868073BD4F3F928C3C34B1377AC3954A",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","VarunV766",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

You were not satisfied with your room upon check-in and even though the hotel was fully occupied, your room was changed to H5 after your satisfaction of the view. We would like to clarify that H5 is not the 'old wing', but the newest wing of our hotel.

"Cozy stay with impeccable service","5","2012-12","2012-12-14","My husband and I were considering several options as we planned our trip. As it was difficult to gauge the quality of houseboats online, we decided to pick a hotel. My husband was the one who found this rare gem for us.

The property is large, set in one of Srinagar's best areas, and very well maintained. There's a children's play area and a well equipped restaurant. 

Our room was cozy, with wooden flooring and an intricately carved ceiling, a number of typical Kashmiri sofas and a large and comfortable bed. The bathroom was clean and well appointed too. 

We had a room heater and an electric blanket, which kept us more than warm in the near-zero December temperatures. There was plenty of steaming hot water for our showers.  

We loved the food at Jamal Resorts. Sipping their well made Kashmiri Kahwa, with saffron, cinnamon and crushed almonds, was the perfect way to stave off the cold. I really enjoyed the Wazia Chicken which I ordered from room service. Their breakfast and dinner buffets were quite lavish and were appreciated by all the guests. We especially enjoyed the sevaiya kheer dessert, which was superbly made. 

But more than anything, it was the service that made our stay so memorable. The entire F&B staff (Atiqullah, Altaf, Owais, etc) headed by Imran and the front office and housekeeping guys (Mohammed Yusuf, Majid, etc) headed by the manager Feroze and deputy manager Bilal, gave us a taste of true Kashmiri hospitality.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r147424318-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"450","25813082","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/89/e0/5a/priyapathiyan.jpg","337","21","121","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyaPathiyan","PriyaPathiyan","8A64645E7A72DD5C65D420A7F1280A06",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","PriyaPathiyan",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"
"Perfect stay!","5","2012-06","2012-11-26","My first trip to Kashmir. We were a bit reluctant at first but were convinced by our friends who had recently visited Kashmir. Jamal Resorts in Srinagar was not our first choice. We were staying at another hotel in Rajbagh area of Srinagar. But due to major traffic snarls in that area, we decided to move our hotel to a more tourist location with no city traffic problems. That is when I consulted trip advisor and chose Jamal Resorts. 

The hotel is just perfect and tastefully decorated. It is located in nishat area and near dal lake. All the sightseeing and touristy things are close by. The rooms are mostly on the ground floor. We stayed in the Super Deluxe room which I felt was better than the Suite, with amazing interiors and very spacious. The buffet spread in the restaurant is very good and the food with some local delicacies which were amazing. Being in Kashmir we didn't want to be stuck in a tight building of a hotel and Jamal Resorts gave us that open airy feeling with their open gardens and so much space. We spent most of our time in the gardens while we were at the hotel. In the evening we would walk to the nishat garden market and would hand near the dal lake.

All in all a perfect stay and highly recommended","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r146202560-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"403","52560583","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/22/02/c7/jaswinder-s.jpg","550","23","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaswinderS10","Jaswinder S","A0661FBEFC3C3B672FCC6996155C3D85",,"34225","Florida City, Florida","Florida City","JaswinderS10",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

The hotel rooms are good but a bit small.In down stairs rooms bath tubs are not available.As requested to front desk they upgraded us to upper rooms on foc basis,that rooms are attached with bath tubs.It was very nice talking with reception.I really appropriate their behaviour.When I complained for bath tub.the food was of good quality and the staff was very helpful.I would specially like to mention about staff,they are so helpful I have  never seen.The meat quality was ok,but the overall preparations were very nice.

"Dont ever go there!!","1","2012-10","2012-11-03","I had been to this place for 4 nights in Oct 2012.  I also went by some of the comments on Trip Advisor stating that it is good, etc., etc.,  However,  having travelled all over India and the world, I find that some of the folks that have rated this property as good - must have really stayed in some very bad places earlier!!! sorry - but this is my opinion.  First of all, the photographs may look good on web-sites, but the room is ""COLD"" and nothing special.  Except for the bed which has heated blankets, the entire room is 'unclean' / cold and not worth the ratings!!  In fact i stayed in a ""super deluxe room' - the front of the room was a high tiled parapet - later on realised that the room was above the 'main kitchen' - lots of noises from down below!  The tea comes only by 7.30 AM and no one picks up the 'room service' or 'house keeping' nos. when called before 7.30 AM.  The hotel reception does not guide you - but rather keep mum and does not provide any advice on where to go and what to do, etc., etc., - which is rather expected when they know very well that all the folks that come to their resort are tourists will normally go to usual places such as Gulmarg / Pahalgam / Sonmarg.   The restaurant sounded exhorbitant from a rate perspective - even though the food served was 'satisfactory'.  Nothing exceptional!  The wi-fi works only inthe reception area and we have give our lap top / ipad / phone - to the receptionst to log-in.  This was ridiculous.  The place is also too far away from the main market and there is nothing around the place in case you need to go for a leisurly walk.  Overall, I was very dissapointed with this resort - and would advise to look for something near the main dal lake area for rooms that may cost similar to what these folks charge!!!!!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r144370457-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452392029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","3","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/npr123","NP R","9F672F6BAF272F63B9992C6D0E4B7A97",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","npr123",,"Guest Relations Manager","173129507","en","2013-08-20","AsifMir","Dear Reviewer:

Thank you for sparing your time and posting your review of our hotel on Trip Advisor.

We are glad to hear that you appreciated our Food quality and taste. We are saddened to hear that you didnt like our room decor and found it to be ""Cold"". Our Bed Tea timing is 730 am but if pre-ordered it can be served even earlier. Our Travel Desk is equipped to provide you with Tour Packages, Local Sightseeings, Adventure Treks, Golfing rounds etc. The timings of Travel Desk are 1000 am to 730 pm. You visited our Travel Desk past the working hours and hence were unable to find any useful information.

We trust that you will not hold this experience against us. We urge you to visit Jamal Resorts once again. I will personally look into your next stay. We would appreciate more specific comments & feedback on where we can further raise the bar, if you could email me at info@jamalresorts.com

"Horrible and dissappointed","1","2012-10","2012-10-31","I stayed in Jamal Resort from 29th October  to 1st November for three nights :

One of the biggest disadvantages  was the location which is around 9km from any local market .
Everything is a fraud - it is not even a 3 star but they charges are like 4 star - for a mineral water RS 75 - cabs are expensive and autos not avialable .The food is below average - when we ordered for dinner came to know that no food except buffet is available which was sad......, since there is no close place to go out one has no choice.

Thank you for sparing your time and posting your review of our hotel on Trip Advisor from your stay with us in October 2012.

We are disappointed to note that your were not satisfied with your stay. Allow me to clarify the management's position on your stay.

Jamal Resorts is located between on the main Nishat-Shalimar Road. Adjoining are 3 markets of Nishat, Shalimar and Ishber. Within 1 km either way, there are at least 15 restaurants, 8 Hotels, and at least 35 Handicraft shops, 1 Large format Supermarket called Nova, and 2 Shikara ghats on the Dal Lake. 

Our travel Desk provides cabs with the most competitive prices in the city. Autos in Srinagar need to be hailed on the road. Our staff always assists our valued guests to get one, if required. 

Your booking was on Modified American Plan which includes Buffet Breakfast and Buffet Dinner. You had asked our restaurant staff to offer you A-la-Carte from the menu instead of the Buffet. This  is not possible, as items ordered under the Menu are chargeable as per standard Hotel Policy.

We trust that you will not hold this experience against the hotel and its services. Kindly email me your next intended tour of Srinagar and I will personally get your itinerary and bookings done.

We would appreciate more specific comments & feedback on where we can further raise the bar, if you could email me at info@jamalresorts.com

"Great 3* Hotel","5","2021-12","2022-01-04","We have been roaming in Kashmir at different locations, and stayed at many hotels prior to this. Most of the hotels were 3* or above, but there were problems everywhere. Some had heating issues, some with breakfast and food, and some had issue with staff behaviour. This was out last stay and the best amongst all of the stays.

Room was good, not much decorated but decent enough. Heating was perfect as there was hot and cold ac which you can control yourself. Previously we stayed in centralised heating system which couldn't be controlled and sometimes becomes suffocating, or they provided blowers which was not sufficient. View from room was just okay.

Food was great. We had great buffet breakfast here only, with many options and good taste.

Staff behaviour was exceptionally well. Everyone including at front desk, at restaurant, room service and everyone else were polite, helpful and friendly.

Other than this, parking was big enough, location was also good as it was at walking distance from Dal Lake ghat 1, many of famous restaurants like Krishna Restaurant, Gulab, CCD were just in front of the hotel, and other were also at a walking distance.

Overall, we loved the stay.

"Mixed reactions","3","2021-11","2021-11-20","1)	This is a mediocre hotel, neither five star nor a budget one – strictly somewhere in between.
2)	The rooms are average in size – you have to be careful of selecting the rooms – make sure that you choose only the 01s and the 10s, as these are the only rooms which offer a view. The rest are facing neighbouring walls.
3)	Beds a okayish. 
4)	Poor bathroom concepts. The aqua area is a single room with zero partition for the bathing area. 
5)	Good working AC. Wifi. Lighting. Charging points.
6)	A strictly professional staff – working on instructions. No personal touch.
7)	A minimal breakfast. Poori, sabji, chhole, dosas, boiled eggs. No confectionary.

A little inconsiderate on hygiene and infrastructure. But at the same time, a decent option considering the location.

"Below average room, nice location & avg service ","3","2021-04","2021-05-09","We stayed there as a family in 1st week of April 2021. We were allotted a room at 2nd floor. The room was pathetic.. Carpet was very very dirty.. And there was a  smell of cigarette... TV unit was in one corner..  Only thing was a there was a view to the room towards the main door..   Hot water is only available during particular timezones.. So when we reached there, there was no hot water available and we had to take bath in cold water only.. 

Food is OK.. But the breakfast buffet is also not good.. There is not much variety.. On the name of fruits, you will hardly see any fruit.. 

After couple of days, they shifted us to another room which was much better than previous room..  But that was last night of our stay there.. 

Good point is location is very close to dal lake.. Kind of walkable from there.. Food joints are just opposite to the hotel ..

Overall nice location, but bad rooms and lack of facilities..

"Bad experience. Not recommended at all !!","1","2021-04","2021-04-26","Don’t understand how this Hotel boasts of being a 4 Star Hotel, in fact the Hotel do not deserves even 2 stars based on the facilities, services and the amenities provided.
First of all tariff is too high and the available services and amenities are Null in comparison of that. Even the basic things like toilet paper roll, hand towels, dental kit and other toiletries are not available in the rooms. Rooms are not so spacious and comfortable; the hot kettle available is not properly clean, in wash room warm/hot water does not flows 24/7, beddings are seem older and not up to the mark overall cleanliness and hygiene was poor.
Further rooms are not sound insulated, you can clearly listen what person in your next room saying or talking. The buffet breakfast has very limited options to choose from.
From the very first view itself hotel looks like very basic and of no attractiveness.
I visited Hotel during 1st week of April 2021 and in these pandemic times no one is following the COVID protocols, staff is rarely seen wearing masks forget face shields or hand gloves. No focus on hand sanitization or maintenance of social distancing.
Had a bad experience here. Not recommended at all !!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r787338011-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,,,,,"0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ankur142857","Ankur Saraf","61A2C5023B8E373DE5D8782A7D83C89C",,,,,"Ankur142857",,"General Manager","797384986","en","2021-07-16","Irfan Rasool","Dear Guest,

"Awesome property","5","2020-12","2021-01-07","The hotel and its staff are very good. We booked 2 super delux rooms for 2 couples. Rooms were great with all amenities. These rooms have AC with inbuilt heater and after a tiring day full of touring srinagar the cosy rooms proves to be very comfortable.

The hotel staff is very responsible and responsive.

Their buffet lunch and buffet dinner is awesome with enough options to offer variety of food.

Their bathroom are fitted with hot water and it is nice even when outside temperature is 0 degrees Celsius.

Little improvement can be done in that their bathroom tiles are little scaled with water marks which needs polishing. If it is done then this property will become best in the region.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r780732158-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","2","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piyushgupta77","piyushgupta77","FC2828DF47B1C92924794275CDD53CCF",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","piyushgupta77",,"General Manager","797545236","en","2021-07-16","Irfan Rasool","Dear Guest,

I would like to extend my special thanks to Ishfaq, Shakira, and Aamir from the front office team, who went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction. Their professionalism, courtesy, and attention to detail were truly impressive.

The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed, with a breathtaking view of the Dal Lake. The breakfast spread was sumptuous, and the food quality was excellent.

What struck me most was the hotel's commitment to customer satisfaction. Every staff member I interacted with was friendly, helpful, and eager to please.

"Good Resort","5","2012-09","2012-10-02","We stayed at Jamal Resorts  during a recent trip to Kashmir -- and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. We stayed in a two-bedroom . The rooms were spacious and well kept. 

What I enjoyed the most was the food. I have stayed at pahalgam but food was not so good , But at jamal Resorts food was excellent and delicious. cooks were very skilled too.  One evening  on request of the Manager we were served roast chicken and fried fish with potato wedges -- again most delectable.
The staff are very friendly and attend to your every request in the shortest possible time. I would in particular like to praise the staff here who are always so very eager to see that you had a good and enjoyable meal. That is a very good management.

It also has Jamal carpet shawl showroom next to it and they give a very good discount to people staying in the hotel. Buying stuff there might come out cheaper than elsewhere.

"Average Resort","3","2012-09","2012-09-06","I've stayed here during my visit to Srinagar for 2 days. I was here for an official trip and hence booked this resort as i wanted to experience a different place to stay. The resort is located far from the city center ( places like Residency road, boulevard etc.), but close to Nishat bagh. It is on an in-road about 1 km from the nishat bagh. This looked like more of a home grown resort rather than a professionally run outfit. Rooms are decent but needs improvement (for e.g. the room key was broken and not changed for long). Though i liked the service of the resort, staff was courteous, humble and always eager to help. Every room is not equipped with wifi internet, so you need to check before check-in. Rooms close to the reception only has internet facility. Buffet bfast was limited (maybe because the occupancy was less), however for a guest at any time, would require min standards.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r139627289-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"450","29794876","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c6/a2/3c/preekshitgupta.jpg","448","61","382","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preekshitgupta","preekshitgupta","18287FC6DC20727C2A4A86E1DEC63C88",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","preekshitgupta",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"
"Beautiful Resot, Service!","5","2012-03","2012-08-21","Jamal Resorts was our primary base while we were in this beautiful vale of Kashmir. It has always been our dream to go to Kashmir, our very own Switzerland. The hotel which was carefully chosen after reviewing all hotels in this category in Srinagar, just like we always do. The hotel is about 35 minutes from the Srinagar Airport. Once you cross the crowded areas of Rajbagh and MA Road and arrive near Gupkar Road and onwards to the beautiful drive alongside the Dal Lake, aptly called Boulevard, only then you see the beauty of this valley with the classic landscape of mountains, lush green trees and the beautiful lake. The drive along the lake is just fascinating and takes you to Nishat Gardens and that is where this hotel is located. 

The entry to the hotel is quite grand with a nice private drive-way along a garden leading up to the hotel wing. The reception is housed in a separate wing is quite large and airy and we were promptly attended to and just breezed through the whole check-in process. Before we knew it our luggage was transferred to our rooms and all very smooth. We had taken 2 Super Deluxe Rooms which were very Pan-Asian to Neo in its design. Nice large rooms, a separate sofa, tea-coffee maker, fridge, Flat Panel Tvs with premium channels, the works. The linen was as good as any 5 star hotel and very well maintained. The bathrooms are as good as any we have been to with a nice sized bath-tub. The accommodation definitely felt like we were in a higher category hotel. 

Since we were on a Breakfast included plan, we were offered the Buffet. Its not the biggest spread in the world but has adequate choices and of good quality. Our Lunch was mostly during our hectic sightseeing day trips so we never tried the Lunch at the hotel. We did have dinner during our entire stay and we ordered a-la carte. We tried all cuisines Chinese, Indian and Continental and we came away very impressed with the food and taste. Nice formal cutlery as well. The service is not the fastest but very reliable and courteous. Just love the slight Kashmiri accent in the English and the Hindi.

We opted out of our last day of sightseeing as it was getting too hectic and just spent the day at the hotel. Just relaxed at the hotel and enjoyed the beauty around the hotel. The hotel is located with Zabarwan mountains on one side and the Dal Lake on the other side. Our children tried the outdoor play area which has slides and see-saw type of rides, so you know how kids never leave form such places. While I tried my hand at Badminton and Table Tennis with my champion wife. Obviously I lost as she was ex-state champion. We walked to the Dal lake and took a short motor-boat ride. The evening was spent in the lawns which has a Garden Café serving beverages and snacks and watching the sun-set in the Lake. A nice end to a beautiful trip to Kashmir.

Overall Jamal Resorts is an ideal hotel, location for a Kashmir trip and tourists should base their travel to excursion sites like Gulmarg and Sonamarg from this centrally located hotel. The rooms, service and facilities are very good and we came back very impressed. ","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r137888768-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452391234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","1200","12","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trevor321","Trevor321","5923653F8C5F410601D82487016EA5A3",,,,,"Trevor321",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

"Jamal Resort, Srinagar","4","2012-07","2012-07-23","Stayed here for two nights 08th-11th July'12. Nice place. Good ambience. We had booked the double deluxe initially but once we got there and saw the room, upgraded to the super-deluxe.It was a bit over-priced but we're glad we did it. Nice food - buffet and room service. We especially loved the Chinese. Wi-fi available in the lobby. So that's a plus. A couple of things - no lifts so make sure you can take the stairs. Secondly, it is in Ishbar, Nishat - close to Nishat and Shalimar Gardens but pretty far away from most other things. I'd say it's a good choice only if you are going to do long day-trips. That way, the fact that the hotel is far away from the main CBD area will not matter.

"Not worth the buck!","2","2012-07","2012-07-17","After reading reviews on Tripadvisor, we decided to stay here for 4 nights during our trip to Kashmir.. The entire experience was poor to say the least..

1. 	The hotel is far far away from the city
2. 	The rooms are well furnished, but lack the basic amenities like electric kettle.. So, there is no provision to make your own bed-tea, and when you order for bed-tea at 7:45 AM, the staff says ""time for bed-tea is over""!!! The room and bathroom are full of flies.. Our room was near the housekeeping room, and we could hear the phone rining through the night..
3. 	The staff is discourteous.. They feel burdened to complete their basic tasks like room cleaning, leave alone helping out the guests..! We had to consistently complain at the reception to get our room cleaned..
4. 	The food is really bad.. Breakfast includes cold paranthas (that too burnt!), stale and tasteless fruits, bread + butter/jam, omlette, porridge (horrible!) and powdered milk tea (served cold).. The restaurant is full of flies.. Even if you order a-la-carte, the food is nowhere near tasty and is extremely expensive..
5. 	We booked a cab through them.. Not only did they earn a hefty margin on it, they also misled us in terms of cab timings and tariffs.. The whole experience left us feeling cheated.. 

All in all, this hotel is nowhere near a 3* also! When you are paying 4k+ per night, you expect friendly staff, full amenities and good food.. Will not recommend this place for anyone who wants a headache free vacation..","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r134674745-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"450","45270812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/b2/c7/1c/vidhisinghal.jpg","503","56","26","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VidhiSinghal","VidhiSinghal","1A58719733BB9FAA3D46ED6B95F91A03",,"12392950","Bangalore District, India","Bangalore District","VidhiSinghal",,"Guest Relations Manager","135863908","en","2012-07-31","AsifMir","Dear Guest,

Thank you for sparing time and posting your review of our hotel on Trip Advisor from your stay with us in July 2012

I am glad to hear that you have liked our rooms and that they are well-furnished and to your liking. Just to re-confirm with you that Electric Kettles are only provided in the higher category rooms. 

Jamal Resorts is located in the main Tourist Area of Nishat, just 0.5 kms from the Dal Lake. Our distance to the Main City Business Centres like Amira Kadal, Lal Chowk is 8kms which are of non-tourist interest.

We appreciate your concerns of room cleaning but as you are aware that during your entire stay you never left your room keys with the Reception for cleaning and Housekeeping services. Your room could hence not be cleaned during the normal hours and had to be cleaned and serviced only in late evenings once you were back from sightseeing. This might have caused a bit of discomfort to you, but as pointed out it was entirely due to your reservation of leaving the keys behind and having the rooms cleaned during the day. 

Our buffet breakfast timings are 0730 hours to 1030 hours. This timing is communicated to all our guests on check-in and is mentioned on our In-room Dining Menu cards as well. Inspite of this your guests arrived late everyday for Buffet Breakfast at 1100 hours or later. This is well beyond our buffet breakfast timings. Due to this you may have found that the buffet is not well-stocked and fresh, as it was well past the closing time for buffet. We did however accommodate you and even provided you a-la carte breakfast free of cost on one occasion. 

Our Travel Desk at Jamal Resorts arranges daily sightseeings, golfing rounds, adventure treks etc services for all our in-house guests. However, we have no records of a cab being booked through us by you. 

Jamal Resorts believes in providing top quality service levels. However we do require co-operation from our guests in adherence to timings and procedures of the Resort to ensure the service levels are not compromised. 

We would appreciate more specific comments & feedback on where we can further raise the bar, if you could email me at info@jamalresorts.com

Your feedback is valuable to us and helps us in our endeavor of constant improvement. I once again thank you for it.

"Not worth the money - not even a proper 3* hotel","1","2012-05","2012-07-07","The Good Part:
We were 3 couples booked by a travel agent for a vacation. We stayed 3 nights in jamal resort in may 2012 towards the end of our kashmir trip. Upon reaching the hotel, we were given 3 rooms. The rooms provided were modern and well furnished. However, they lacked some of the basic amenities which even a 2* hotel will have.
The bad part:
when the bell boy brought our luggage, he started telling us that there was no facility for runnin hot and cold water and the toilets are provide with individual Geysers which take an hour to heat the water. And he mentioned that he is informing this at the time of checkin so that we do not make a fuss of it in the morning complaining no hot water. However, the next morning around 5.30 AM a plumber knocks on the door and says that he needs to check some fault with the Geyser. does some thing and leaves in 30 mins, only to comeback at 7 am again and tries some more repairs. finally gives up and asks the guests to call for hot water and the same was provided in a bucket one after other.
Ordeal doesn't end here, the toilet commode's did not have a hand shower for washing and a bucket and mug was provided as in any cheap lodge
After this, the next morning, we reached the restaurant for the breakfast around 8 am. The cereals were served with Hot Powder milk. The only item in the hot menu had chola puri and the puris were fried atleast couple times since morning and kept for the guests to consume. On complaining, the manager appologised and promised they will not repeat the same thing next morning. In a capital city like srinagar, staff of the hotel said, they used powder milk and could not get fresh milk. This was the reason they could not serve cold milk with cereals. In the breakfast, only thing consumable was tea and bread jam.

we then went to the reception and asked for a checkout in light of all the substandard facilities provided and the manager clearly refused to refund anything. Though we could only get him to sign a complaint letter mentioning all the flaws since our arrival. Only after this, he started to appologise for whatever happened and changed our rooms. next day we were given better breakfast and a dinner in lieu of the earlier day breakfast. Me and my family's entire fun of holiday was spoiled because of the stay here.

Point of Caution: 
Stay here only if you are upto good rooms. nothing else will be good. hotel claims itself to be a 4* property, but i will not even rate it as basic 2*, combine this with staff attitude you are sure to regret the stay here. If anything on the breakfast menu needs replinishing and you ask the staff, they stare at you as if you are a beggar. On top of it, if you have to pay a hefty amount for such an experience, you can better avoid this. Srinagar is a big city and will surely give you better  options for staying than JAMAL RESORT","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r133675191-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","18","50","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mahaveer83","mahaveer83","7E46E4E60EFDEA5D5F70E28E39F0853F",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","mahaveer83",,"Guest Relations Manager","135512339","en","2012-07-26","AsifMir","Dear Guest,

Thank you for sparing time and posting your review of our hotel on Trip Advisor from your stay with us in May 2012

We are glad that you have appreciated our Modern Rooms and that they are well furnished. Our rooms have the latest 32"" LCD TV with HD Connections, Electric Kettle, Mini-Fridge etc to name a few. 

We accept and understand that one of the 3 rooms allotted to you on your first night had issues with Hot Water. It was a genuine failure and we accept our mistake. It happened due to teething problems of our new rooms and we make no excuses for this. You were promptly shifted to different rooms the next day and you have expressed satisfaction over the rest of the stay in your review.

We understand your disappointment and anger due to this problem with Hot Water in one of your rooms on Day 1. We have made all our efforts to make the rest of your stay comfortable and we are glad you have appreciated the services of F&B and the Rooms for the rest of your stay. 

We request you to judge us on an overall experience based on your complete stay of 4 days and not just on your experience on Day 1. We have already offered your agent a credit for the faulty room on Day 1. Jamal Resorts believes in providing good guest experiences and your feedback has been presented to our training team to improve our infrastructure and services even further. 

We would appreciate more specific comments & feedback on where we can further raise the bar, if you could email me at info@jamalresorts.com

After reading so many reviews about the Jamal Resortst , I decided to go for it.And I would like to thank every reviewer as they were absolutely right. Its fantastic place to be in.As soon as you enter Jamal Resort, the affection bestowed by the managerial executives make you feel ""AT HOME"" You feel happy. The staff are very courteous, and always carry a smile.

A remarkable place, where smallest of your requirements are being taken care off. They provided me rooms on upper part.The rooms are cosy n comfortable. The Food quality is good- and customer's taste bud is being taken care off.

Though the place is far away from the main city, but that is- I believe ""the advantage"" One enjoys the serene & tranquil environ of being in the foothills of  mountain.........

Thank you for sparing time and posting your review of our hotel on Trip Advisor from your stay with us in March 2012

We have retrieved your booking and would like to clarify with you once again that we do not allow 4 Adults in 1 Deluxe Room at the resort. It is clearly against hotel policy and has been explained to you and your travel agent prior to the check-in and at the time of booking. Your original booking read 2 Adults and 2 Children, whereas you were all adults, over 18 years of age. We believe you were disappointed but you or your agent have mis-represented the age of the guests traveling. Jamal Resorts and its management tried to resolve the situation but it is clearly impractical to fit 2 Extra Bed Cots in 1 Deluxe room. You had requested to lay out mattresses all over the room, but only Dharamshallas allow that, not 4-star resorts.

We would appreciate particular comments & feedback on where we can further raise the bar, if you could email me at info@jamalresorts.com

Your feedback is valuable to us and helps us in our endeavor of constant improvement. I once again thank you for it.

"lovely Stay","4","2012-03","2012-04-05","it took place only When  I cancelled the booking of Royal Khazar,after stayed one day.  . Right from the location, the ambiance, the artistic and tasteful decoration, the courtesy, everything was so appeasing. We really relished our stay to Jamal Resorts I was willing to Extend some more days unfortunately shortage of Time and flight was already booked .
 
As per the facilities i ask for the games we were told presently they can provide carom,badminton other games are under process as the manager showed the places.
We were told that this place was converted into a hotel just a decade or two back.Had the Kashmir been peaceful , this would have been the most popular hotels in India

The interiors were very tastefully done up and it never felt like one is checking into a hotel. You feel that you are staying at the home of a royal Kashmiri family. 

There's a beautiful lawn  you can see the view  of  hills... where you can take strolls in the mornings and evenings.I went to Reception and ask them  to put some of chairs and tables in Garden it happen only in single minute I was really  enjoyable.

The staff is extremely polite and well mannered. The food and beverages too are great and served with silverware. They will ask you for the kind of food, go for the kashmiri meal, its worth having a go. It is rich in oil, Kashmiri Dum Aloo & Al Yakhni  is a delicacy.

As for as the hotel is very good to stay for two to three nights for couples and the  family mostly the childrens can easily pass their time  in a big space.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d1625318-r127340384-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"205","19820680","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/88/avatar009.jpg","205","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/insh25","insh25","82B060477B35D49B9879BA9466D221CA",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","insh25",,,,,,,,"JCI Complex, Ishber Nishat, Srinagar 191123 India","Srinagar","India","191123","Jammu and Kashmir","JCI Complex, Ishber","Nishat","1625318","34.133244","Srinagar, Srinagar District, Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir","74.876686","Jamal Resorts","222","3.6","29","20","35","72","66","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297623-d1625318-Reviews-Jamal_Resorts-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html","http://www.jamalresorts.com/"

"Pathetic experience!!","2","2019-10","2019-10-14","My husband and myself recently visited Shringaar for a brief holiday and booked our stay at the Batra Hotel which is not far from the Dal Lake. Even though the communication services were down we still thought we can enjoy the nature in the laps of the majestic Himalayas far from the busy hussle bussle of life for a while. 

We needed a peaceful stay but fate had otherwise in store for us. Traveling from Mumbai one does feel the temperature difference instantly. Although it's warm during the day but since we had an early morning flight, we could feel the change. The hotel guys gave us an executive room on the 3rd floor which looked fair enough and spacious on first glance. But my first thoughts were on the heating facility available. There the Management informed that since number of customers were few heating element was off and they could oblige us by providing a simple heater!! 

I had to inform the Management this was not done for the money I was paying and we needed comfort. I was firm on this. Finally they shifted us to one of their so called best rooms on the 5th floor where the heating element of the AC was working. But the complimentary basket was empty, doorbell not working, night light out of order. Best was the washroom where you get hot water only in the morning and if you want to have a bath in the evening then God help because there's no hot water. To make it worse, there was a bad water leakage just above the head when in front of the basin!! So in that cold since washroom is not temperature controlled, as you brush or wash at the basin, you have cold droplets of water falling on your back constantly which is not only uncomfortable but highly irritating. 

The Management were called and informed about all this but nothing changed during our 3 day visit. Even difficult to believe but the Wall clock in the room was not working which got rectified after a day's stay! 

The buffet breakfast is just about bearable but highly unmanaged. You have to call and ask for basics like water. Most of the time buffet is laid just like that without any staff. So if you are in a hurry you had it! They are very slow in their service also. If you eat out that's better but if you want to order your lunch or dinner here then God save you!! You will be actually wasting your money because the food is pathetic. The chapattis are hard and brittle and the curry is watery with absolutely no taste. Even the rice used for pullao is very inferior quality. Moreover Most of the food items on the menu card are not available. Only Indian Menu available as per chef and there too you need to compromise.... If you ask for X you can only get Y, you ask for A then only B is available!! And for all this you pay a good amount of money. 

To top it all, after a full day outing or when you want to go down for breakfast and remain energetic for your full day ahead you come to know that the lift services have been stalled and is under repair which would take time. You would feel like hitting your head against the wall because you have to negotiate the steps through 5 floors either way!! 

For all these challenges at the hotel, the Management is absolutely cool and apathetic to the customer's discomfort. Since the hotel belongs to the Batra group of Delhi it's quite a shame as it's bringing down the name and reputation of the group. I think they should look into this matter and revamp the hotel for a better experience of travellers. All the Best!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r718456282-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"450","423569677","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/3f/29/0d/avatar.jpg","450","28","28","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/550pamela","Pamela Ghosh","2B44057CC9601BD8E646DAF4797A4D97",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","550pamela",,"General Manager","835124197","en","2022-04-18","Jaydeep Bhat","Dear Guest

"Horrible experience.","1","2019-06","2019-06-18","*Important Message:* 

Dear all Group Members, 
                   Myself Sanjeev Mohan DGM, Overseas Healthcare, North, I am here to share that I have made a booking with Hotel Batra in Srinagar almost 20 days back from 17th to 22nd June for 5 days. Yesterday I started  my journey at 3.00 PM from Jammu but because of Traffic Jam in Banihal Tunnel I struck up there and reached Srinagar 8.30 Morning. In between I have informed 5 times to the Hotel staff to keep my booking intact because I coming late due to Jam on Highway. But to my utter surprise Hotel staff given my room to some one else and asked me to wait till someone checkout. 

       Dear friends  this is not the happened first time, in December also without informing me they changed my room in between my stay and all my luggage was transferred to an inferior room by saying that Room lock is faulty. When I left in the Morning it was 100 % O.K. Even Centrally Heating System was not Working and after putting a Room Heater in my Room, light of the room was tripping after every 5 minutes. Then I decided not to make any booking in this Hotel but after 3 calls from Hotel reception with apology, I repeated the same mistake again.

      3 days back they make this group to provide good services but I am fail to understand that what type of services they are providing to their regular Corporate Customers. Sorry but I will not repeat this mistake.

   Regards. 🙏","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r682443765-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,"1200","452387885","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33sanjeevm","SANJEEV M","53EE96D44BD2DAD6259BD6BB21CBEAFF",,,,,"33sanjeevm",,"General Manager","835124471","en","2022-04-18","Jaydeep Bhat","

"It might be a nice place to stay in but be aware before booking!","1","2019-02","2019-02-18","This something about the hospitality of Batra Hotels. I had a trip planned for Srinagar, and this was a business meeting. However, due to the sad incident occurring at Pulwama just 3-4 days before my intended date of travel, I had to cancel my trip; I was still contemplating the trip but just a day back there were news of skirmish with the security forces. However, due to the confusion, I missed my timeline of cancellation, and now Batra Hotel is charging a full amount Rs 3615 for some reason of their own. The hotelier refuses to communicate over a conference call (as I had booked via goIbibo) and states that we will only go by our policy. Having said that I would request everyone to be wary before booking such hotels because they have only the commercial part to think about and will never realize what the customer is going through.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297623-d3653779-r653398220-Batra_Hotels_And_Residences-Srinagar_Srinagar_District_Kashmir_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html",,,,,,"0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86kumar86","Kumardeep Paul","70298949D628D683B2A67A7BB0194F92",,"297615","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Gurugram (Gurgaon)","86kumar86",,"General Manager","660266704","en","2019-03-21","Batra H","Dear Guest ,
