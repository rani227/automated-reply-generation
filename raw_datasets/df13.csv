"An average experience for a pricey stay","3","2025-10","2025-10-22","The Hotel is out of the city. The food is just about okay. The menu is very limited and the staff won't put in any efforts to customise the food as per your needs. The  room we stayed in was dated. The hotel is not a palace as the name may suggest so be aware of the fact. 2 Half litre bottles were provided for 2 adults and 1 infant. As the hotel is away from the city be ready to shell out extra for cabs/rikshaws on ola/uber.

"Worst experience: Property infested with rats and cockroaches","1","2025-09","2025-09-29","I visited Jal Mahal Resort with friends for a couple of days and it was the worst experience of my life. The place was so dirty as if it had not been cleaned in a very long time. They first put us in a room which had such a dirty toilet that we had to get our room changed. Then in the new room, we woke up to rat poop all over the floor! When we asked them to clean and shift us to a new room, it took them a good three hours to even clean the room and they did not relocate us to a different room. The next morning we again woke up to rat poop all over our room. When they cleaned our room, they did not even replace our dirty coffee mugs. We kept the mugs outside our room only to find a cigarette stubbed in the coffee mug kept outside our room the next day. This is when they claim to be a smoke free property. 

They refused to give us more than one key card per room despite repeatedly asking for the same and even though they knew we were multiple people staying in a room! They were so uncooperative and rude in each of their interactions that we had to stop engaging with them.

When we went to their outdoor  restaurant to eat at night and it was filled with mosquitoes, we asked them for mosquito coils. They were so stingy that they kept two small sticks of not even an entire coil, the result was that we were bitten by mosquitoes as we were trying to eat food.

The bedsheets and curtains in the rooms were so unclean that all of us woke up to allergies and sore throats. We were sick for most of our trip thanks to this.

We had to complete our entire stay in the property because they forced us to pay the entire amount upfront at the reception while checking in. I guess that makes sense because who would want to continue living in a property which is infested by rats and cockroaches.

I would strictly warn anyone against staying at this property because it is a complete health hazard.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r1032754727-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452389492","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","1200","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShivangiG67","Shivangi G","2540FDA78F553F2EF9528E390E9455ED",,,,,"ShivangiG67",,,,,,,,"Bannur Road Varuna, Hobli, Mysuru (Mysore) 570011 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570011","Karnataka","Bannur Road","Varuna, Hobli","7291214","12.308354","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.7294","Jal Mahal Resort & Spa","118","3.4","25","7","18","30","38","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d7291214-Reviews-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.jalmahalresort.com"
"Substandard service","1","2025-09","2025-09-29","My stay at Jal Mahal Resort was deeply disappointing. Upon waking up, I discovered rat droppings in the room, which is completely unacceptable for any accommodation. Additionally, the housekeeping services were inadequate and did not meet basic standards of cleanliness and efficiency. The behavior of the hotel staff was also troubling, as they were consistently rude and disrespectful throughout our stay. Furthermore, the resort’s policy of demanding full payment on the day of check-in felt unreasonable and added to the overall negative experience. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this resort based on my visit.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r1032660672-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452388731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate56434201939","Navigate56434201939","6FABA65FA7BAB6C4C8744D3977E03CC2",,,,,"Navigate56434201939",,,,,,,,"Bannur Road Varuna, Hobli, Mysuru (Mysore) 570011 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570011","Karnataka","Bannur Road","Varuna, Hobli","7291214","12.308354","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.7294","Jal Mahal Resort & Spa","118","3.4","25","7","18","30","38","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d7291214-Reviews-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.jalmahalresort.com"

"WORST NIGHTMARE OF MY LIFE! HARRASMENT FROM STAFF! STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHADY PLACE!","1","2025-09","2025-09-28","I had gone with my friends and my 2 year old to celebrate my birthday. I made the worst mistake of my life by choosing this place. I entered this place and found uncleaned, algae filled fish tanks and ponds everywhere. I had made 50% payment on booking.com before arrival. But they forced us to make full payment before  we even checked into the rooms. I have travelled across the world and this is the first time that happened. Bad first impression. It only got worse from that point. We had uncleaned toilets in the room we were given. They changed our room after repeated requests and the second room had rat poop! (Photos attached). They had kept 2 towels for 5 people. They refused to provide extra plates, cutlery and glasses. They in fact came to our rooms and threatened that if we didn't return the drink glasses by 10:30 they would charge is by the hour for them! They also gave us only 1 key card per room. I had to return with my 2 year old baby in between an outing and forgot to get the key from my friend's bag. They refused to give me extra key to let me in my room. After multiple requests and complaints, someone used the master key to let me in. No extra key was provided even then. 
I spoke with Arun Kumar the general manager of that place. He said he'd come and handle it it 5 minutes. Never showed up even during checkout. He only came when I threatened to not pay my food bills and harassed me, my child  and my friends with threats of harming us. I had gone to celebrate my 37th birthday with my fellow professor friends in peace (I mentioned the age and profession so you understand that we weren't a notorious,loud bunch). I was honestly scared for our safety - not just hygeine and stay wise, but also physically and emotionally harassed by everyone on the property - especially the GM, and his management team. Please stay away from this place even if they give you a free stay if you value your health and safety. We were forced to stay the whole time because they harassed is to pay the full amount at checkin. Would have run in the opposite direction otherwise.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r1032498263-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452389307","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaside08463631222","Seaside08463631222","22374562C94ADAE1BBDC6D019B3FBBDB",,,,,"Seaside08463631222",,,,,,,,"Bannur Road Varuna, Hobli, Mysuru (Mysore) 570011 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570011","Karnataka","Bannur Road","Varuna, Hobli","7291214","12.308354","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.7294","Jal Mahal Resort & Spa","118","3.4","25","7","18","30","38","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d7291214-Reviews-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.jalmahalresort.com"

"Do not go here, its a NO NO NO NO NO from us.","1","2025-02","2025-02-17","We were staying in the Jacuzzi suite (#302). Below are the few things you might want to take a look at before booking your stay here. 

1. The first thing I always check is bathroom. and when we enter the room looks good but later we realised that the bathroom fittings are worst, everything was just temporary fixed, the clothes hanger is broken, The flush water is leaking and so on...

2. The coffee cups were stained and even after informing the reception it hasn't been changed. The door locks were pathetic. The drawers weren't closing properly. The mini-fridge which was suppose to cool down water/beer was hot enough as it wasn't working. 

3. Every individual will want a locker when they travel. The safe which which was given to was so safe that it never opened. 

4. We then realised that the toiletries weren't changed from the previous guest's use and had to get them changed after informing at reception again... 

5. The sofas were dirty and torn, the outdoor game was more like some random backyard.

6. About the indoor games, the queue tips were missing the and I wonder what kind of people go in there, they have played pool/billiard without informing and the balls are full of marks. 

7. The only good thing is the food service and the food... Special thanks to the restaurant staff (Ms. Ranjitha and Mr. Arjun) who took good care of the food and our lunch/dinner experience there. 

Not worth the price they actually quote us. Luckily, we got an offer from booking.com and hence saved about Rs. 3000 (Guessing it.. And yeah, the pictures or the videos on YouTube might impress. you guys (which happened with us), but that is either paid or it was shot when the resort was opened newly. The hotel management says for any occasion inform them so that we can surprise us, we came here for our 15th wedding anniversary and we are already surprised and disappointed with the service and to add on, they didn't bother to give whatever surprise they wanted to.

Thanks for making our stay as decent  and peaceful.
Maintaining such biggest area, is really a hard core beauty.
you are doing and did well during our stay.
Pool, parking, indoor  and outdoor are really made kids to relax well. Cycles for kids and adults for making them to enjoy well. Foods are nutritious.

Manager, Puneeth Kumar , sheriff, Pradeep, person who maintain pool, coffee bay madam and over all people doing responsive and fast service to clients. Well Done.

What would i suggest please maintain a permanent air freshener in RESTROOM. Separate pools for kids. 1 ltr water etc....for make your service more valuable.

But over the service provided is excellent...

Thanks

"Not so pleasant stay","2","2023-12","2023-12-27","This review is based on my one-day stay at the property. Though I didn’t get to explore all the aspects at length, it was a not-so-pleasant experience. The rooms are nicely spread but it gets over as soon as you enter into it. Extremely small rooms, provided with a small table, which is filled with chargeable-chips/dry-fruits, you have to struggle to even keep your phone/key. Charging the phone is such an affair, as there is no table near the electrical points. There is no towel in the room, imagine!! Tea in the restaurant is pathetic. If you are in look for stopover at Mysore as part of your long trips, it can be considered but in that case you can opt for properties which are close to city centre and at more affordable prices.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r931160699-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"2304","80213172","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/c7/f4/b4/swagatika20.jpg","3072","6","69","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swagatika20","Swagatika P","8E1A5EC6756AD9B62325665E40B533C1",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","Swagatika20",,,,,,,,"Bannur Road Varuna, Hobli, Mysuru (Mysore) 570011 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570011","Karnataka","Bannur Road","Varuna, Hobli","7291214","12.308354","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.7294","Jal Mahal Resort & Spa","118","3.4","25","7","18","30","38","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d7291214-Reviews-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.jalmahalresort.com"

"We Stayed there for 5 days","2","2023-09","2023-09-24","Our experience fell short of our expectations during our 5-day stay. In the initial 2 days, we encountered a few issues. Firstly, the breakfast was not served hot, which was disappointing. Additionally, when we informed the reception about our preference for an eggless cake to celebrate a birthday, they mistakenly provided us with a cake containing eggs.

Moreover, there was a lack of South Indian dishes on the lunch and dinner menus, which made it less suitable for kids. Furthermore, the swimming pool lacked facilities for children, and the service from the staff was notably slow.

It's important to highlight that this property is more suitable for short one-day weekend stays.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r918277077-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452390706","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tejaldhulla","Tejal","5153B88C20DEAF7D78521F4353C1F943",,,,,"Tejaldhulla",,,,,,,,"Bannur Road Varuna, Hobli, Mysuru (Mysore) 570011 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570011","Karnataka","Bannur Road","Varuna, Hobli","7291214","12.308354","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.7294","Jal Mahal Resort & Spa","118","3.4","25","7","18","30","38","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d7291214-Reviews-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.jalmahalresort.com"

"Unacceptable ","1","2023-10","2023-10-24","The rooms were average with twin beds with a gap in between but the worst thing about this hotel is the service, rather lack of service. 
Nowhere else had I seen the breakfast being delayed beyond 8.30 am and the guests are treated like unwanted intruders. Though we informed in advance that we need to leave by 8.30 on the third day, they started serving the breakfast at 8.35am. There is nothing great about the breakfast too. Fixed menu with rocky Idlis and Dosa, a below average sweet and a vada,which was only good element. When we asked for coffee on both days of stay, the waiter came with tea and told us to drink it and get lost. Mysuru unable to serve good breakfast and coffee was a shock.

"Safety is a joke here and is not a concern of the rude staff.","1","2019-11","2019-10-31","As a frequent traveller I can confidently say that this hotel was the worst by far.The staff are very rude and impolite.
I had booked the room for 3 nights but due to safety issues of the staff opening the room in the middle of the night with the master key, I had to check out the very next morning.
The door doesn't have safety features like a tower bolt,so the ONLY method of locking is by the provided keycard.
When I spoke to the front desk in the morning about this,they blatantly told me that the service boy denied opening the door and wasn't even interested in listening.They very rudely turned their faces as I was talking to them.
Even the amenities they provided were used - the tissue in the bathroom was almost completely over and the coffee sachets were ripped open.

To sum it up I would say this is the worst hotel I have been to with highly rude and untrained staff and it possess SAFETY ISSUES.

Not recommendable at all.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r722929430-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"450","458352461","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/51/e7/4d/caption.jpg","450","0","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adityav617","Aditya V","83673F0D58FD31ADBB7D7BE87F6C5F97",,"297675","Coimbatore, India","Coimbatore","adityav617",,"Manager","738874339","en","2020-01-13","hotelgoldencastlemys","We regret for the inconvenience caused ,we have updated our standards of staffing ethics we honor each and every word of guests and correct it immediately

"Good hotel but not good reception staff","4","2019-03","2019-03-25","Hotel rooms were good as we booked 3 rooms, we checked in at 9.30 pm after visit of Brindavan Garden, hot water was available 24 hrs. Water bottle was not kept in one room and glasses were not kept in one room. No restaurant, staff not help in arranging food so we had to go nearest Khan restaurant to have food at night 11 pm which was good restaurant. Even reception staff denied to give plates in room. He not allowed to exchange room- E.g. we had booked 3 rooms for 7 people so friends wanted to sleep 4 - 3 in 2 rooms and wanted to use one room in morning for freshen up only. But reception staff was asking extra 500/- Rs. per person in room as we booked 3,2,2 adults in 3 room so he said you can't sleep more in one room. What rubbish..! He was not having any problem as already we booed 3 rooms for 7 adults so if we sleep in one room also, what was his loss. No breakfast provided although we paid for booking, he said it will come after 8 am and we wanted to go early 7 am.

"Not the place it used to be","1","2019-03","2019-03-25","I had last been at Golden Castle when it was under Treebo more than two years ago, so my reviews will be based on that first experience which was very positive. The hotel has changed (worsened) a lot since then and seems to be running on a shoestring budget. Everything that could go wrong, did on my recent stay. 

We had to change room because the AC wasn't working properly and in the new one, the AC made intermittent noises but we decided to let it pass. Poor staff responsiveness, staff having noisy conversations in the corridor, torn bedsheets (replacement was requested, which were also slightly torn), non-functioning tea kettle (again replacement was requested, which was broken but worked), delayed and limited breakfast, no lunch/dinner because the restaurant was supposedly being ""renovated"".

If you are a new, first time visitor and are okay with or can manage with such an experience, it's another matter. For us, this was for sure our last stay at the hotel. Can't imagine going back after this, especially the way our fond memories from the last stay have been wiped out.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r661003593-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mr_maneshkumar","Manesh Kumar","3B7E6F39ADEE5197AB5F48180A5E8169",,,,,"mr_maneshkumar",,"Manager","739051821","en","2020-01-14","hotelgoldencastlemys","Dear Sir,

"Dissatisfied Stay Experience.","3","2018-07","2018-07-29","We stayed in OYO 14139 Golden Castle, Mysuru for 2 Nights. This Hotel is situated in a location, which is easily accessible from Mysore Railway Junction and KSRTC Bus stand. Rooms are well maintained.

But, the services are not upto our expectation. 
1.I booked one room for 2 persons on 08.07.2018 for 2 days from 24.07.2018 to 26.07.2018, with option ‘payment to be made at hotel’. I received a message that “Booking is confirmed and we will call you closer to the check-in date to confirm your arrival time’. But I did not receive any call from OYO till 23.07.2018 Morning. Hence I called OYO Golden Castle and informed my arrival time. I also made the payment thro online banking on 23.07.2018. But OYO did not make any call to me.
2.No towels were provided and only one set of toiletry kit with very small Nourishing soap, Body and Hair shampoo and moisturizer. On request only, they are providing Towels, Toiletries etc., (Image is attached)
3.Next Horrible thing is Food. OYO has committed in their email sent to me that “Buffet Breakfast will be served from 8.00 AM to 10 AM”. (Screenshot is attached). But on 25.07.2018, they provided 2 Medium sized idli, one small vada, Kesari bath in small cup, Upma in a cup and a coffee in small cup. No Buffet – All items were served in a single plate, as under noon meal scheme. On 26.07.2018, they provided set dosa (3 No. dosas with 4 to 5 inches diameter), Tomato Rice bath in a cup and a coffee in small cup. (in a Single Plate). Highlight of this Breakfast was that my wife was served a half cooked broken plastic spoon (top portion) in the Tomato Rice bath. I made a complaint and they committed that they would not serve it in future.
4.Room no.203 was allotted. Noisy split A/c. I made a request on 25.07.2018, to set right the A/c, but, no response. Service quality is poor. 

OYO is not offering facilities free of cost. As we pay, we expect value for money. 
Not very happy with our stay at OYO 14139 Golden Castle, Mysuru (Mysore), Karnataka. 
I will advise everyone to think twice/thrice before booking OYO Golden Castle, Mysuru.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r600804650-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","10","126","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrupakarRamanathan","KrupakarRamanathan","629C0B143C7B6F0EFCE1B3E5F236C1EE",,"297675","Coimbatore, India","Coimbatore","KrupakarRamanathan",,,,,,,,"#3615/1 Sayyaji Rao Road Opposite Old RMC, Mysuru (Mysore) 570021 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570021","Karnataka","#3615/1 Sayyaji Rao Road","Opposite Old RMC","8728730","12.321884","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.64647","Golden Castle","362","4","20","23","43","142","134","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d8728730-Reviews-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.hotelgoldencastle.com/index.html"

"Slightly hidden from sight ","3","2019-02","2019-02-07","This place is just near Lashkar police station.
The entrance is designed in such a way that you might miss it when walking the street.
It's only 20-30mins walk from Mysore Junction train station and 5-10mins walk from the bus station. 30mins walk to Mysore Palace entrance and St Philomena Church but both are on the opposite sites of the hotel.
The hotel provides breakfast but the diner is too basic does not look very clean. It would also be cheaper to have room booking w/o breakfast and you can still go and order breakfast ala carte from the diner. Pay per order of course. 
You can get food at walking distance.
Just next door there a eatery where people eats while standing at the table. Yes, the tables are high and the chairs are normal size. I tried idli and tea here. Cheap price and a big idli. I ordered 2 and couldn't finish the 2nd. If you want decent food where you can sit and enjoy meal, better walk around. The hotel have WiFi but you have to ask, and then they will key in the password in your phone. They don't provide it written on papers.
If you want the room cleaned, pass the key at the reception and tell them so. Or else, your room will be untouched.
The people also can arrange taxi service, tour service, call in the auto (the scooter type vehicle) for you. Of course there will be a mark up.
The room is not exactly sound proof so, basically you can hear everything that happens at the outside walkway as though you're watching it on live TV. For that, I give average. If you're a light sleeper, find a better place.

"The best 🏨 in Mysore!","5","2017-12","2018-08-12","I've been in Mysore few times and also tried other hotel's but nothing like This place!!!

The quality of service and rooms are impressive, it made me choose again and again...

Wonderful and clean rooms, best services, very comfortable beds and bathroom were clean. There were also Lockers in each room I believe and they also have a restaurant/cafeteria upstairs where having small snacks.

Important thing that it got WiFi networks very good, not like other places where .0 network we get.

Overall my favourite and only place in Mysore!

"Good location","3","2017-02","2017-03-17","I stayed in two rooms, the first air conditioned with a useless refrigerator for $33 a night including breakfast and the second when no ac rooms were available for $20 a night without breakfast and no pretend refrigerator. Save $3 and don't have breakfast included. While the food was good it costs a lot less than that and anything cold to drink is extra. Also a refrigerator that is ""only a little bit cold"" i.e., will not cool drinks let alone freeze water is useless. The toilet paper rolls provided are tiny. It's a shame that such stinginess, refrigerator, breakfast juice or water, and toilet paper ruin what is otherwise not a bad hotel. With a little bit of common sense this would have merited a better review.

"असुरक्षित अनुभव – Viceroy Comfort","1","2025-07","2025-07-23","★☆☆☆☆ असुरक्षित अनुभव – Viceroy Comforts, Mysore की लापरवाह मैनेजमेंट

मेरा Viceroy Comforts, Mysore में ठहरने का अनुभव बेहद निराशाजनक और असुरक्षित रहा। होटल में सुरक्षा की कोई व्यवस्था नहीं थी। एक संदिग्ध व्यक्ति को कमरे के पास घूमते देखा, जब मैंने इसकी सूचना दी, तो स्टाफ ने कोई कार्रवाई नहीं की। न सिक्योरिटी को बुलाया गया, न ही कोई जवाब मिला। मुझे अपने ही कमरे में असुरक्षित महसूस हुआ।

सबसे खराब बात थी होटल प्रबंधन का व्यवहार – वे बेहद रूखे और गैर-जिम्मेदार थे। उन्होंने मेरी शिकायत को गंभीरता से नहीं लिया और ऐसे बर्ताव किया जैसे यह कोई बड़ी बात ही न हो।

मेहमानों की सुरक्षा से खिलवाड़ करना बहुत ही शर्मनाक है। अगर आप एक सुरक्षित, सम्मानजनक और जिम्मेदार सेवा की उम्मीद करते हैं, तो यह होटल बिल्कुल भी न चुनें।

परिवारों और अकेले यात्रियों के लिए कतई अनुशंसित नहीं।","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r1020534176-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452389492","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32seemaa","seema a","9D01B04CAF57D2A3D9D863D9E1B1637B",,,,,"32seemaa",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

The room they gave us (212) smelled like mold that even gave me allergy and the wifi signal kept disconnecting. I asked to change to another room. In the next room (202) the wifi signal was better and the mold smell was not strong. But the air conditioning smelled like mold again. We decided to stay in this one thinking that probably all the rooms smelled like that. 

At night I wanted to take a hot shower before going to bed and the hotel didn't have hot water. I called reception and I was told I would have hot water in 10 minutes. After 10 minutes I tried to take my shower, but no hot water again. I called reception again and again after every 10 minutes and every time I was told I would have hot water in 10 minutes. I had to wait around 40 minutes hearing the same excuse. I ended up taking a cold shower. 

In the morning I had another shower hoping this one would be hot. It started hot but after 3 minutes the hot water was over. Cold shower again.

They provide Internet access for only one device. For the second device they charge extra.
So they don't provide BASIC things like hot water but charge you for Internet access.

Very poor hotel, even though they try to impress you with nice decoration at the lobby. 

It is worth paying more for a better hotel that doesn't try to deceive you with nice decoration or with the reception information.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r622279723-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391289","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1200","4","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicas118","Monica S","3423347B3DA36FEC8C45EEDBD5782A25",,"47216","Socorro, New Mexico","Socorro","monicas118",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"
"GOOD PROPERTY BUT DISAPPOINTING SERVICES","3","2018-07","2018-08-01","I had stayed at Hotel Viceroy Comforts for 3 days from 27th Jul, 2018 to 30th July, 2018.
The receptionists Sinchana and Ranjana were extremely helpful, hospitable and the check-in was done quickly and efficiently. The general area, passages, lift are all maintained very well. Spacious property and the ambience is good. The room allotted was quite spacious and well-done except for a broken glass in the side wall panel. I reported the same to the reception to be inspected as it could cause grievous injury and as a guest I didn’t want to be questioned about this damage at the time of checkout. However, for the 3 days I stayed at the hotel, no one bother to inspect it. Then came a series of disappointments :

1. Did not get hot water supply in the bath. Tried informing the Housekeeping which almost doesn’t exist in this hotel as I experienced in the 3 days of stay. Subsequently, I requested the reception and then the hot water valve was opened wherever it is located.
2. On day 1, I had a problem with the flush knob in the bathroom as it was getting stuck and copious water was flowing in the closet which couldn’t be stopped. I brought it to the notice of housekeeping (through the reception as housekeeping never ever lifted the phone whenever I tried for them in the 3 days of stay). They got it temporarily fixed through a housekeeping staff. However, it again repeated in the evening and enormous water got wasted overnight. I again lodged a complaint on the same. Nothing much happened except providing a temporary fix. Hence I requested for a change of room on the 3rd day which they obliged.
3. Daily cleaning of the room, change of towels - housekeeping was skipped on the first two days and they obliged when I requested for it on the 3rd day.
4. Daily Breakfast has a choice of just two pre-fixed snacks apart from bread & butter. Evening snacks options almost don’t exist. I was told I can order tea or coffee.
5.  No newspaper was provided despite being requested for choice of newspaper the guest would prefer.
6. You have a problem viewing T.V., the housekeeping will bring a T.V. remote and set it right but take away the T.V. remote. You are only provided set-of-box remote. 
7. The most disturbing (dis)comfort was with their WiFi connection. They provide a daily plan token which the guest has to use daily by entering the login and password. Except for couple of hours of WiFi, I could not use the WiFi for the rest of my 3 days of stay as it wouldn’t connect. At the reception, they did try to help me by providing alternative tokens and in fact, they even tried several times int the 3 days getting my mobile connected with the hotel WiFi but couldn’t do so. They expressed that, probably there was a problem with their WiFi Server. In fact, WiFi was one of the main motivation for me to book my stay at this hotel. This was a big let down !!!! 
8. 90% of the staff don't understand any other language other than Kannada - this is true with the house keeping, room service, restaurant and some reception staff. Is this a 3 star hotel in a tourist centre !!!??? 

I believe, going by the pre-requisites of a 3 star category hotel which Hotel Viceroy Comforts is, it leaves a lot to meet with the expectations of its guests and also the necessary provisions and services.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r601774957-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","331698028","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/c5/4f/6c/slkumar.jpg","50","4","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srinivasanl2018","Srinivasan L","C0BCBD31F33195C99EDC43483EE0377D",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","srinivasanl2018",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

Few problems with Hotel which needs immediate attention

1>	Poor room service. I ordered Fresh Lime soda, for which room service took almost 40 mins and reminder call. 
2>	No mineral water in room. Only regular RO purified water was provided.
3>	I found small cockroaches coming out from bathroom. I complaint same to reception twice but no one came. Then I had to use my chappal to deal with them.  (Of course on cockroaches, not on hotel staff)
4>	On 20th Morning suddenly hot water supply stopped that wasted my 30 mins.

"Best Location- Average Food- Poor Services","4","2018-04","2018-04-16","The hotel is located centrally in the city with a quick connectivity to the major tourist sites in the city like The Mysore Palace & Mysore Zoo, Karanji Lake etc.

Checked-in the hotel for a weekend i.e. 14-15th April.
The hotel has a huge parking space with around 42 rooms. I booked a room for 2 people with a 'King Size' Bed.
The room was big enough to accomodate 2 people and their luggage. The room had an attached washroom (not so big in size), an almirah, AC and a flat screen TV.

The foor served was pretty good (South / North Indian food options available) in taste and the cost was also pcocket friendly.
Bar is not availble in the hotel premises, but you can bring in your own booze and can order some food to accompany your drinks. (Green Salad & Chili Paneer are saviour.)

The services offered by the hotel was not so good infact they were poor. The room service time was unexpectidely high and the intercom system was pathetically mis-communicated. The staff was least bothered about the guest's comfort and requirements.

There was free Wi-Fi available in the hotel which didn't work for the complete weekend because of some network provider issue and the mobile network reception was also poor. Hope the internet problem is sorted soon! 

The hotel is a good place to stay with your family & friends and enjoy some good food at the roof-top restaurant. The room services can be inproved for better ratings.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r573666963-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1440","421085432","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/19/40/f8/deveshgarg0204.jpg","1440","45","63","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeveshGarg0204","DeveshGarg0204","9745071591CB84145266ED0418B109EE",,"644043","Noida, India","Noida","DeveshGarg0204",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

We were initially told that breakfast will be available at xx time and later we were not even provided a complimentary breakfast. The breakfast cost was ₹200 per person. Our worst experience was the dinner. The hotel menu says that it serves the dinner till 10:30 PM. We reached the top floor restaurant at around 10:05 PM and started seeing menu to order food. The waiter insisted us to take buffet rather than going for A La Carte however we didn't wanted to go for buffet as we didn't like menu. We had ordered soups, Biriyani, etc from A La Carte and the waiter was like, Sir, thik hai, mai try karta hoon isko laneka..Later when the food came, it was horrible, panner chilly was full of oil, Biriyani was not even Biriyani, the rice was cold (more than room temperature), and later we found that, it was the same rice which was leftover in buffet, they tried adding few things, and was served to us. The Fresh Lime Soda was a disaster, even a child can make a better soda than what we were served. We we 8 people and we had occupied 2 tables, both tables were served horrible food. The only thing which was served properly was curd rice as there were only 2-3 ingredients to mix and it was easy for anyone to do it. I think the chef left for the day and there were other people experimenting with food hence the waiter was insisting to go with buffet.

USP for the hotel was the pure vegetarian restaurant downstairs. I'm a non vegetarian, but ended up having all the meals in the vegetarian restaurant itself.

"Good hotel , good location at a VERY good price!","4","2018-03","2018-03-14","I was doubtful about the quality of the hotel when I got an AC room for slightly more than thousand rupees  , I couldn't imagine that a good hotel at a walkable distance from the railway station and right in the center of Mysore could be so inexpensive!

But I needn't have worried , the decision to book was a right one and the hotel turned out to be VERY good. Rooms were neat , big enough and with functioning A/C and hot water. Service was very good with the front desk manager offering me a late checkout without making a fuss (like the manager at another Treebo property in the city did). The only drawback was the below average quality of the breakfast. They should improve that. 

In short a very good choice for staying in Mysore.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r566531584-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"205","19820680","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/88/avatar009.jpg","205","97","124","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SridharCanada","SridharCanada","C2CA8B1BF930372DAB7BEE330D68612F",,,,,"SridharCanada",,"Guest Relations Manager","567493239","en","2018-03-19","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Unpleasant stay","2","2018-02","2018-03-03","We stayed here for just 1 night. Room was certainly OK when we arrived, but then they called us during our trip in Mysore City that we had to come back to change rooms. We couldn't do that, so they took all our belongings and moved it to another room. This room had a terrible smell of smoking and did not have the facilities that we booked for. The staff did not come with a solution exept that they sprayed a few times in the room. Not a solution for our problem. Food was OK, but not everything on the menu was available. It's an OK hotel to stay when you have a very low budget. Location is also OK.

"A jewel of a hotel in Mysore","5","2017-01","2017-01-30","Kings Kastle is in the city centre and therefore very close to every tourist attraction, all shops are near, and so are the bus stand and the railway station. You could not find a better location.
You will appreciate in inner courtroom in the hotel, the secluded parking space, the lofty landings, the cosy Reception corner with settees to rest and most of all: the amazing staff, the friendliest people behind the desk, ever so helpful, friendly, efficient, courteous and fun!
Shabaaz Khan was brilliant, on the email before I went, he phoned also and in house; Naveen was there as well, and I can't find a flaw with them. I was very lucky to meet with the Manager as well, who is the brother of the owner. There you go: a family business! I firmly believe that behind this team is good management, customer service is a great quality in this hotel. 
A very similar good service is also given by the housekeeping staff: the rooms are spacious and clean, bathroom has all amenities and hot water 24/7; a kettle is provided, a safe, etc, good fans, the lot!
The Restaurant, Darbar, has excellent food to offer, it is on the third floor. I disagree completely with the customer who said the tables were dusty. They are not new, but clean. Again you will get great service and very tasty food!
As for your sightseeing: the Reception desk will advise you of where to buy the cheapest and best silk, the real sandlewood; they can service you with taxi and guides, if you wish.
For info: you can take the local bus from the bus stand to Chanmudi Hill for 30rps, it runs all the time. May I also suggest the Dance Museum on the way down from the hill, there is a bus stop there and you can hop on the same bus again after your visit. Plenty of auto rickshaws also to be hired in the street for good price. Bargain!
I enjoyed this hotel and when back in Mysore, I will make it my home again.
Thank you to all!

"Average Castle ","3","2016-07","2016-07-18","It is quite an average castle. Looks like it became okay after Oyo pitched in. 
The rooms were neat and clean. We were a gang of 8 people and 4 rooms were booked. Although all rooms were of the same price level, one of those rooms I guess was newly renovated and hence was wanted by all of us.
The hotel has a restaurant 'Kings durbar'. Most people just place the order over phone. But you must go and see the restaurant and you wouldn't order food. It is not recommendable. It is not hygienic at all.

"Rip off","1","2015-09","2016-05-16","This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.  There were bed bugs.  Except for the  friendly doorman, the staff were very surly and unhelpful.  When I left  they tried to say I hadn't paid.  I left early.  Also it was not a cheap hotel.  Wifi was very slow to arrange and then I was not supposed to tell any other guests about it, even though it was advertised.  This hotel made my trip to Mysore memorable in all the wrong ways.

Regret for not matching your expectations. We failed as you wanted items which are served in street side carts. More over there was no delay in service as per our records. 20 minutes is the standard time taken in any hotel. Also if there are no complaints or request, you should not expect the GM to leave his dinner, come and serve you. More over your concern of hiring some one should be restricted to your business, otherwise it looks like you are checking the price of cow when actually you have come to buy the milk. From your statement it looks like you had some personal vendetta against resort and me although i don't know you. We can only wish get well soon

I visit Jal Mahal so many times, that I have just lost count. I know the staff by name now. I have never found a  better friendlier, scenic, pet friendly,  family friendly, couple friendly ( pocket friendly too) hotel than this. 
We have visited before with our pets, and this time, with elderly people. Right from the security guard to reception, to the busboy, we felt very welcome. 
I can never forget the fact that the staff went out of their way to give my daughter hot chocolate milk, in the middle of the night because her throat wasn't feeling great.
Ask for Chef Vinod particularly, if you want any specific delicacy.. even if it's for your furry companion!
It's a wonderful hotel, resort, restaurant, homestay, home, everything combined together into one. Special thanks to Mrs. Deepa.

We can understand your
frustration . You have hidden the actual facts.You checked in with a local I'd along with a guy. After couple of hours when he left,you wanted to use the room again with one more lady which was not allowed as the intentions and behaviour was doubtful. Then u demanded 50% refund which was denied. Later till late evening you ventured into the pool with your friend and checked out late in the evening. You personally attacking another lady shows your malicious mindset. The resort is at no fault and we had to safeguard our interest.We have the proof to substantiate our claims.

Noted the feedback and will definitely look into this. Our regret for not matching your expectations. Have verified with the team, and found that you had booked 7 rooms. You had an issue from the beginning with paying the advance on arrival , and then a free upgrade to a suite room.  You only disturbed other guests during your stay.

"Good experience ","4","2023-04","2023-04-16","Stayed there for two days.
It is a quite cosy resort located a far away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
The rooms were good, service was fast. But the best part of the resort was the taste of the food. Almost every item that we ordered was extremely delicious. Overall a nice experience.

Cons :

1. The size of the bathroom is small and felt a little suffocated
2. Breakfast buffet is bad with very limited items and mostly south indian items. It needs to be improved

Thank for your review. FYI, we follow strict dress code in the pool. We have never mentioned about baby pool and our pool depth varies from 3.5 feet to 5.5 feet. The breakfast all the items would be available , it is only when all customer come at one time, takes time for refilling. The elegance room is infact big and has an area of 380 sq ft.

"Not good","2","2022-06","2022-06-12","I stayed there for 3 nights with my husband and two kids in a suite room. Let me point out everything.
 In suite room there was no door for bed room... So wats the use of having living n bed room seperately. This is highly irritating. I have stayed at many resorts and hotels but haven't seen such a worst interior. Everytime we need to change dress should we tell others to go out of the suite room!!!!! Also the wooden floor makes some noise while walking which should be taken care. The bed was not soft n was hard to sleep. 

Next was the bar service... It was really worst that on June 9th when we went to bar, they told us to take drinks in resturant and not in bar. Then why should they have seperately bar n restaurant. The families who were taking food in resturant were uncomfortable on seeing us with drinks there.

 Next comes the pool... Oh my god there was no swimming tube available as i don't know swimming when I asked they told none of the equipment are in good condition. Such a worst reply from them. On June 11th they told pool will be opened at 7.30 in morning. So when my kids went at 7.30 on they told to come at 8 o clock since maintenance work is going on. But again at 8 o clock they told it will take 1 more hour for maintenance work to be completed. Such an irritating response.

Next is TV...i have booked the room well in advance and even after I checked in it took more than 2 hours for them to activate tv channel that too minimum channels only.

Next is food... Breakfast taste was not bad but spread was poor. Also there was a big ant in sambar. On seeing that my kids hesitated to eat. 

Next is staff... They all were polite and friendly. That's a good part in staying there.

Next is spa... Good service.

Ambience is good. That's all. Overall my stay at jal mahal was not pleasant. Will think twice before recommending this resort to my friends.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r842496457-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452392461","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg","1200","1","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radha_Vinoth","Radha","DAE5638A07A11BB0E1B6F990E38DB2B0",,,,,"Radha_Vinoth",,,,,,,,"Bannur Road Varuna, Hobli, Mysuru (Mysore) 570011 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570011","Karnataka","Bannur Road","Varuna, Hobli","7291214","12.308354","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.7294","Jal Mahal Resort & Spa","118","3.4","25","7","18","30","38","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d7291214-Reviews-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.jalmahalresort.com"

Regret for not so great experiences. You had stayed in room # 212/214/215 . We had checked the rooms and found no crack/ break in the bath tubs. Generally we don't enter the room to give stay back service unless requested. On your request it was given to one room and other two rooms were not attended on time as the team member didn't realize that it was the same group. It was delayed and rest of the two days it was given promptly. The TV channels were in working condition. Even there was no arguement among staff as stated by you, it was just they were talking in kannada language. The property is 8km's from the city. We don't claim to be perfect, but just clarifying on the facts

Their restaurant serves good food. We had set menu for breakfast and dinner and both times food was decent. Room service was ok, not very prompt. AC was functional and cooling was proper. 

When we stayed again on 18 May, it rained heavily at night and some of our group members complained about leakage in their rooms at night. So much so that some of them were awake till 1.30 at night trying to wipe their belongings that were drenched. A lot of people were complaining about it in the morning, but people sitting in the reception were unmoved. 

Since we were with a group and traveled in the group bus, I am not able to say anything about proximity to market etc.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r489250463-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","237297681","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/24/e0/11/pune-seema.jpg","50","19","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124seemak","Seema K","4D7311766570C0411CC577A7F694C4DB",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","124seemak",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

Bed and Lenin's are not clean , a.c performance not good , a lot of sound but no adequate cooling effect, 
Now the worst part : BREAKFAST - FIRST DAY  idli,  upma, toast and cornflakes were served on table , everything was measured and served as if they were serving it's for free 
Next day it was a buffet , the plates which were stacked had generous coating of dust and only change in the Menu was plain uttappa instead of upma every thing was literally ice cold on both occasions, service at the restaurant was worst.

"Descent. Value for money. ","4","2018-01","2018-01-21","Booked this place on treebo and costed us around 1100/- for a night. The stay was only for one day. The location of the hotel is very good. Nearby palace and railway station. And the locality is quite descent and not filthy. 

The hotel has small parking limited for max 8-10 cars. Rest have to park outside. Your car may get stuck if someone else has parked ahead of urs during check out. So be careful and be the last to park. The watchman is very helpful. 

The bed room and wash room were quite clean. Ac and tv functional. Room didn't stink.

Since we reached on Sankrantri, the restaurant for the day was closed in the night and the hotel refused to provide service at restaurant or room service. 

The next morning for the inclusive breakfast only a limited dishes were available. Idli, juice, bread jam butter, etc... no dosa.

Overall comfortable stay for a night.

"An awesome place where you will be charged for an empty plate.","4","2022-05","2022-05-25","A well planned resort with vast area of green plants trees, ponds, park and playing area for kids. A nice swimming pool is another attraction. The look is like a palace. Rooms are spacious and comfortable.
The restaurant serves tasty dishes with a special Kannada touch. You will love the lawn restaurant with sipping wines.
The hanging dining table with chair us an innovative idea.
NEGATIVES
1.Front office is non responsive. I've complained about the TV which was not working. I complained four times but no service technicians attended. I couldn't use the TV for the entire period of stay.
2. I asked for two plates from the restaurant for using our fruits purchased from Mysore. They politely told me that each plate will be charged Rs 20 each. My FIRST EVER EXPERIENCE IN A STAR HOTEL.
I don't know the logic.
3. There are two types of staff. One is extremely helpful and supportive especially the north east staff. The other a few are hostile. When I asked for some drinking water on the dining table, he showed me the area where water is kept.
4. Getting a taxi, Ola Uber etc is very difficult. Try to travel with own conveyance 

Still I recommend this beautiful resort for families especially with kids.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r840012413-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","1","28","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rajammi","DR JEROMI","8541ED6D70392435522487F2CFE221D2",,,,,"Rajammi",,"General Manager","840301400","en","2022-05-27","Jalmahal resort","Dear Guest

"Very Disappointing and highly inorganized","1","2022-03","2022-04-01","The Resort as such is very nice and clean, but the team there are highly uncompetitive to handle crowd. The day I landed, there was a marriage happening and obvious was crowded. As result I was not given a parking, while the booking mentioned as parking included. Hairdryer not available as standard, but requested one was not usable, the rooms are clean, but had broken wash room accessories, blocked sink and most important of all absolutely no flexibility in breakfast timings. when I requested for a late breakfast, the reply was a blunt ""NO"". 
To reach out to a manager to talk about the discomfort, it was 30 mins wait for me at the reception. I could not also cancel, as it was a advance payment at the time of booking. I finally decided to checkout changing the plan to another alternate location. 

Since I am a frequent traveler, I am generally used to hotels and resorts with better hospitality and flexibility. This was not the fact at this place. Hence a very poor rating for my side.

"My experience in the hotel","2","2022-03","2022-03-04","Nice place for stay and very delicious breakfast.

You might be wondering why did I give 2 star even though it's nice place for stay with awesome breakfast?

Here is the answer:
We had selected executive room with breakfast for myself, wife and small kid. As we were travelling via Mysure, we wanted to spend night there and take some rest. We reached hotel around 10:30 at night. We slept and next day morning, we were checking out after breakfast. They send a person to check the room and the person came saying Kettle is not working. However, we didn't get time to even plug in the kettle to check that is working fine or not. I conveyed same and they checked with their management. They concluded that it might be by someone else and we were not charged extra. But, it was very embarrassing situation for us. When I shared this experience with one of my friend, he mentioned that same thing happened with him before 2-3 years.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r830104371-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452361217","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kartiknshah","Kartik Shah","8884BFD2783BFDB638E2293BBB1F2F13",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","kartiknshah",,"General Manager","830365000","en","2022-03-07","Jalmahal resort","Thank you for feedback.

Since we went on the new years eve, we expected some delays in the service but the hotel staff was professional and tried their best to take care of the customers. But that is one area of improvement for the Jal Mahal team.

Also the rooms are not so clean and specially the bathrooms can be much better.

"Pathetic jal Mahal palace","1","2021-12","2021-12-27","This hotel was recommended as top best stay at Mysore. As so we booked the hotel. Though the facility at the resort is good, but following are the main draw backs and why I wouldn't recommend 
1. Even after the booking room at this restaurant. The management don't have a courtesy to call us and confirm the booking and arrival. We need to call multiple times.
2. I request for simple candles for the dinner as we are newly married couples. There was not response from the management. 
3. Outdoor dinning was available but they didn't even mentioned in arrival and showed us the path to highest noisy indoor dinner hall with no cultured guests and staff who are busy in there own billing business.
4. After dinner was ordered. It arrived after 45-50 min and first only ordered food we brought without any serving plates and we kept requesting them, then no spoons, then we requested for sauce and salad was just a dream.
5. None of them served the food. They just kept the food on the table for the dogs to feed.
6. Besides, I observed that the plates kept outside the door upon room service we lying there from the day of check in to check out.
7. While booking it was offered that there would be free parking. But initially parking inside the resort was denied and then provided later in some corner without any dedicated parking space.
8. Towels and bedsheet we old and not replaced.
9. Only single quantity of shampoo and soap for a couple was offered for a couple and with no hand wash in the washroom. I wonder what nonsense is this.
10. Non of the staff in the dinning area speak kannada and give us the option to talk in Hindi or English only.
11. Morning breakfast complementary, but worst than night dinner. All food were prepared early morning and served cold and donuts were hard as stones. 
12. Dinning tables we not cleaning regularly and dish plates were not cleaned properly.
13. They neither provided tissue paper for cleaning the plates too.

Thanks for sharing your feedback. We highly regret for the inconveniences caused to you. We have looked into the case, and found that there was a delay in restaurant service due to the long holiday rush and indoor restaurant was the only place available for dining. The outdoor restaurant was full to offer you with guests waiting. From the tone of your comments, it looks like you are more keen on a personal attack than being honest in your feedback. FYI, calling our other guests uncultured, make us doubt on your culture. Please note we cater family crowd with kids and can't be operating as silent zone. Why you expect someone to speak in kannada , when you can converse in english. FYI we have employees who can speak multiple languages. We don't take any special arrangements in our common dining on a long weekends and holidays. Any special requests are entertained only on weekdays and with advance booking, at extra cost. We operate a resort and not provision stores to stock candles. The plates are cleared and left in the corridor from departure rooms to be picked up later. Parking is ample and on first come first serve basis. We expect you to be well versed with how resort /hotel operates as we don't call any one if it is a prepaid/ guaranteed booking. Our plates are cleaned and wiped, so no need of wiping the plates again. On your other observations we found everything fine and nothing average.

We wish both of you a happy married fruitful life ahead. You are always welcome as our guest and I am sure you will definitely have a change of opinion

What made me to write this.

2. I booked a room with 3occupancy as per the option available on Agoda, during check-in hotel declined the booking that we don't accommodate 3people in a room. And forcing us to upgrade the room with additional 2.5k cost.
3. Room service is is a disgrace. They charge you glass, and extra Utensils 🤣
4. Front desk is full with arrogant people. Even their so called GM. GM was trying to be an old uncle, was asking about my relationship with occupants. I mean seriously.

Greetings from Jalmahal

We have looked in to the matter. We want to put this on record so that the other people on this platform can know the truth.We had made it very clear when you called that executive room can't take 3 adults and a pet. The hotel was sold out and we could give you an alternative as there was an early check out. Even you can check now, We don't sell base category rooms on Agoda. Still we were trying to help you by contacting Agoda in the late evening. The resort has every right to safeguard its image and verify the authenticity of its customers and that too when 2 men and a lady wants to share a room. We are not here to check your relationship status and least interested in that. You were threatening us with your high contacts of knowing the district SP and show us what you are. We are very particular about the guest id proof's and its a internal policy not to entertain the above configured occupancy to share the single room. This is not limited to Jalmahal only and a standard protocol followed everywhere.

Calling the GM as a uncle itself shows your wrong attitude, arrogance and lack of maturity. You must familiarize with the hotel practices and get accustomed with basic guidelines.

The breakfast is not charged extra to you. But you want to feed your dog with 4-6 eggs from the buffet counter free of cost is definitely a no to us.

We wish you could be a little more polite and professional in your approach. Our guest's are our bread and butter, but one can't expect the hotel staff to be their glorified slaves.

"Relaxing holiday with our pet","5","2021-09","2021-09-13","Jal Mahal is a great place to visit with family, friends, and pets. Yes, pets!!!! Though we selected this resort mainly because it was pet friendly, we realised that this decision was the best ever made. Jal Mahal is a beautiful property, with amazing food and hospitality. We stayed at the Jacuzzi Suite, and wow! What a great experience it was!! Chef Vinod is great, so is Anjum Ma'am... And the General Manager. Yes .. within two nights of staying at this place, we were able know these dedicated people, who run the place very well. We weren't really worried about the lack of use of the swimming pool or other activities ( due to strict COVID protocols that the resort has to follow as mandated), we really didn't miss any of these much. Our entire family was happy, including our pet ( who was treated really well) and none of us missed these things.
Food was amazing, so was the ambience. 
This is one of the best pet friendly resorts you can visit. One of the best resorts even otherwise. They have a specially curated menu for pets! Yes!!
It may not be the biggest resort ever, but the best place for a relaxing holiday ( with or without pets) . But if you do have a pet, this is ONE property, you HAVE to  visit!!!!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r809768968-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,,,,,"14","65","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2800sushmar","sushma r","1E966ACF39CEDA5B3672FF8F320E9982",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","2800sushmar",,"General Manager","810052889","en","2021-09-14","Jalmahal resort","Dear Ms. Sushma

However, the following needs immediate attention :

1. The mattresses on the beds are too soft and not comfortable for aged people, especially for those who have back problems.
2. The height of the commode in the toilet was very low and no support handles on any side, again a serious issue with aged people.
3. We found poor and dirty towels in the washroom which was replaced promptly once we complained.

Greetings from Jalmahal. We regret for not meeting your expectations. We have checked your booking details and found that you had paid 10k for 2 classic rooms with extra bed in one room inclusive of breakfast and taxes for all 5 adults and kids. You had spent roughly Rs.250 per person per meal which we think reasonable. Additionally you had spent around 1500 rupees on dry fruits and beverages from mini bar which was optional. FYI  all our indoor and out door activities are operational  except pool which is closed as per covid guidelines. We found out that you had requested for lunch and dinner to be included in the room package which we could not accept. The  standard and quality comes with a price, we don't want to compromise on our standards by underquoting.

greetings from Jalmahal
At the outset accept our apologies for not meeting your expectations. We have note the content of your feedback. Will definitely  take the corrective measures.
 From your booking , you had booked a classic room thru OTA @ a price of just Rs. 3750 inclusive of breakfast and taxes for 2 which is the most economical and best deal. The room is sold at an average price of 5K. You arrived by 5Pm on day 1 and checked out by 11:30AM . It will be a wrong on anyone's part to make a statement without exploring the entire resort.
Breakfast is an elaborate spread of fruits,juice,flakes, bread,4-5 south indian, eggs, coffee/tea which is good enough in the category of resort.  We do not agree with your statement of dirty pool, as we have dedicated staff to monitor it open to close. We have no where marketed on the baby pool. We have a pool with a depth of 3.5 feet to 5.5 feet.

Please note we are not justifying ourselves, but the clarity is given for other guests who go thru the reviews to know the facts. We wish and expect you to be more honest and genuine in your feedback while you review anything at least in future.

With warm regards
For Jalmahal resort, Mysore

"Decent & Budget Hotel","3","2016-10","2016-10-28","This is was my second trip to Mysore, it was pleasant stay in Hotel Viceroy Comfort. I was with my wife and 2 & ½ years daughter. 

Hotel & Room:
Hotel staff was helpful and without any special request been made during the booking, receptionist allowed up for early check-in. Room was neat and clean.

Food:
Hotel do have a restaurant, but I felt it was not fully equipped kitchen, as they have only option of buffet dinner and no “a la carte menu”. In buffet, they served only vegetarian food and no non-vegetarian option is available. In break-fast as well they have limited menu, which is good at some time.

Overall I would say it is a decent, average, budget hotel, near to Mysore Zoo and Mysore Palace, easily accessible and easily to find.

"Not as expected .....!!","2","2016-10","2016-10-13","We stayed for only one night in this hotel during Dussera time & I would say, it is just a place where you stay overnight whenever you are travelling to your next location. Even for this, there are A LOT of better places to stay in Mysore ! Considering the sheer timing & high demand for hotels during holiday season, I had no other option to my budget except to choose this hotel.
Pros: > Location of the hotel is an advantage. near to the city center.
> Ample parking space (it is just inside the same compound of a marriage hall)
> Relatively spacious rooms
Cons: > The working staff are not professional & are very rude
> For the quality of the room, it is highly overpriced ! 
> The quality of the bed linen was pathetic & was re-used from the previous guest stay !!! I had to call the house keeping (which they did not pick up)& had to call multiple times to request for replacing it !
> Food is not that great 
> Check-in was not smooth & we were made to wait for more than 45 mins for the room to be ready from the previous checkout. Unfortunately after our travel with kids, we were made to wait for long !
> Bad odor inside rooms, & the wall adjacent to the AC had seepage due to dampness
> TV was not working & we didn't even try to contact anybody knowing the response would delayed !  
> When Wifi login was requested to the from office, they asked to come back to the reception area to get the credentials !! The expectation was as compared to other hotels, they have to make sure they give out the login & PW during the time of check-in. May be trying to save some bandwidth / usage ughh... !!

Overall, not at all a favorite place to stay, & if you go by my suggestion, please look at a better option with much cheaper pricing.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r427778144-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","29","66","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NagBV","NagBV","DE86871B73012B5AB8C5E4E6EDC1BEB9",,,,,"NagBV",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"
"Very nice hotel for family stay","5","2016-09","2016-09-07","First of all I would like to thank you all guys for your review. Based on your review only, I selected this hotel and it was a very nice one to stay with Family.

I will narrate from how I reached there. Please note that guys from outstation, get some auto/taxi and tell them that MG Road, next to JSS Hospital,Rajendra kalyana mandapa.(initially I struggled to get this proper address and when returning from Palace I recalled the places nearby and explained to Auto drivers which make hassle free to me to reach here). Please note that this is annexed with that Marriage hall. As soon I entered, the receptionist gave me a warm welcome with smile and she is very polite and excellent in explaining all the things(nearby places  and hotels) and how to reach there and telling the Auto fare as well. I went with my family and room was very neat and clean.

From there the palace is at walkable distance(later I come to know that straight road leads to palace J), but since I am with family and not clear about the routes, I took auto and reached there in 5 minutes.

In the Roof top, they have a hotel attached, but it was costly and nearby we can get one hotel and it is reasonable and good in taste. Even though I tried once in their roof top restaurant, I ordered noodles, even-tough it is good in taste, they poured lot of oil which could be a mistake but later I did not tried there, so I do not want to make wrong suggestion on this.

I stayed there for one day, the next day morning is Ganesh Chaturthi, so I planned to go for a temple, they were very much interested in guiding me to the temple which is having 101 idols of Ganesha. Later I went to Siva temple, which is opposite to the hotel and it was very nice experience. Also when I check out, some guy from hotel got an auto and the receptionist debated with the auto driver and later he agreed for 80 rupees for a drop to junction. Near to Mysore Junction we can find a hotel named as Adyar Anandha Bhavan, a VEG restaurant, which is good in taste but little costlier.

So overall my experience is very good in the hotel. I can recommend who ever plan for a good stay with family can choose this.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r415752087-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452388761","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AzhagupandianJ","Azhagupandian J","B7465D57B15B6EF56879809C0AF78297",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","AzhagupandianJ",,"General Manager","449519902","en","2017-01-05","viceroycomforts","Dear Sir, Thank you so much for your kind feedback after your recent stay in our Hotel The Viceroy Comforts We are very happy that you enjoyed your days in Mysore and hope to have you with us soon again.","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

"Nice Family Hotel","4","2015-12","2015-12-26","Hotel is situated closer to all attractions. I always try to avoid using my car for sight seeing. Firstly, it is difficult to find the routes in a new location. Second thing is the safety of car parked in a public place. This hotel has huge parking space with 24 hour security. We checked in closer to 2 PM, left the car at hotel and managed all the visits by auto rickshaws. Auto rickshaw drivers at Mysore are very friendly and fare is low. Hotel room was big and well maintained. View from the room was horrible (All you can see is wall of next building).

When we reached the Hotel, receptionist said room was not yet ready and we need to wait. We waited sometime and room got allotted. Room was very small and Cot was damaged one and we could not sleep properly. Also so much of noise from outside in the night, totally disturbed place.

"Good for stopover for rest","3","2014-08","2015-06-07","Had stayed here in august 2014, i was on a bike ride with 2 of my friends and heading towards ooty from hyderabad. we decided to stay over and an autorikshaw driver suggested us this place while asking for directions.

the room was decent enough for the price, and the washrooms clean.

Hotel didnt had hot water and we kept on calling reception and the reply would be same ""it will be available in 15 mins"" this carried on for whole night but there was no hot water, next morning we had to shower in icy cold water bcoz we were stinking after previous days ride.

we could not check the restaurant in hotel.

if you are heading towards any farther destination and want to use mysore as a stopover for a nights rest, this hotel is good enough due to its good location and budget pricing.

the hotel has parking which is a plus point considering the location of hotel","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r278508440-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,,,,,"11","73","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sohel87","Sohel87","A77609209219800EFB7F730AA74E710F",,"679014","Secunderabad, India","Secunderabad","Sohel87",,"Manager","380486167","en","2016-06-07","ragtan","Dear Sir,

Since the booking was done on goibibo with discount, no bill was provided (Does not make any sence, due to which i could not even claim for refund from my office).

Cold dinner was served.

Bedsheets had stains and had to request to housekeeping for a new one.

when you plan for a trip to mysore please book your rooms in advance and make the confirmation message from the hotel through mail or message.

I was traveled to mysore on 23 Sat 2015, and i already booked my rooms in kings Kastle in advance , i was booked 2 four bed family room Rs 3000/- each including tax ,i insisted them to provide their account number to transfer the amount ,but person who is responsible for the bookings told me ,your room is already booked so you dont need to transfer the amount, then i said ok to the guy ,but they didnt give any confirmation message to me. when i reached there hotel they told me ,i booked 2 three bedroom room for 3500 including tax. At the time of booking the rate for 4 bed room shown in trip advisor is 3200(offer price) but when i contact directly they told me Rs 3000/-.They are actuly cheeting me by saying the amount ,they told me their person is booked the room correctly and it was my mistake and also told me they will not give four bed room Rs 3000/- it will be minimum of Rs 3700 including tax.
They ask me to show the booking message for 4 bed room but i did'nt get the message , they told me they will send SMS for every booking , if they send SMS for every booking i will get the message for three bed room, but i didnt get any SMS 
when i asked that they told me there room is not available. 
The actul thing is they are barganing the rate with me ,fist time he told me 4 bed room is not available then i told them i dont want your room then after some time they told me they will give the room but not for the rate Rs3000/-.They clearly know i was travelling with my family and i will give the whatever the amount ,but i didnt stay there and i took other hotel .","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r274347840-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","365744489","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/cc/d1/69/ranjithranjan.jpg","50","1","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RanjithRanjan","RanjithRanjan","DE6E2A8C68568F84476A6E52DE9AAA11",,"297633","Kochi (Cochin), India","Kochi (Cochin)","RanjithRanjan",,"Owner","533680789","en","2017-10-17","ragtan","Dear Sir,

"Comfortable but with some cons","3","2015-05","2015-05-12","For staying the hotel is quite fine. The rooms are comfortable. They are not the luxurious types of room but they are okay for night stay. Toilets are clean but like the rooms, don't expect something extraordinary. So on the good side you get great location, comfortable and clean rooms, mini refrigerator, complimentary hot beverages, locker, spacious rooms while on other half you'll suffer from poor food quality and restaurant, time-limited housekeeping, horrible led lights luminating the rooms, not at all sober or comfortable for the eyes. But they do provide wall lamp shades and table lamps. Overall its quite good considering the budget.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r271539689-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452390812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evan_Mazumdar","Evan_Mazumdar","EE9621D2F17E7C47CD22A58A170AB2A2",,,,,"Evan_Mazumdar",,"Manager","380487497","en","2016-06-07","ragtan","Dear Sir/Madam

Then from a trusted source I came to know that hotel service boys will spy on you from that holes.
again I went to reception and told them to change the room they said all the rooms are occupied.

I have stayed earlier with almost all top 5 star labels but this too was very good, comfortable. After Mysore I went to Ooty again I stayed with Treebo hotel. They also offer breakfast in the package though it is not lavish 5 star type but tasty with limited 4-5 items. Overall good experience for me.

"Just don't waste your money","1","2017-11","2017-11-10","I stayed in this hotel this week (until yesterday) and writing this review immediately so that others can avoid wasting their money. I booked the double room for for holiday stay and went the my wife. A simple double room in Mysore during this off season time costed about 2000 per day. Hotel and room looked good in pictures but very ordinary in reality. Simple summaries are as below.
: Room are small and simple four walled. Just a double cot and few wood work. 
: Coffee, tea water in room are rationed to exact number.
:Bath room does not have any thing but a soap, bucket and mug. Even basic amenities like dental kit/shaving kit not provided.
:News papers are not provided even when asked.
:Car parking space is poor.
: Vegetarian restaurant attached had very tasteless preparation. Complimentary breakfast is poor quality.
: Only saving grace is soft-spoken employees. But it won't compensate other short coming.
Think before hurrying to book by seeing in net. Such rooms should not cost more than ₹1200.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r540080338-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452389492","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","1200","0","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJSimha","AJSimha","2ACD21CC9A173D782FD78E5A6F641012",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","AJSimha",,"Guest Relations Manager","540950486","en","2017-11-14","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

We thank you for the stay. While we regret for not meeting your expectations, wish to inform you that  the lowest size of the mattress in our resort is 72 X 78 inches. This is perfect for a family with one small kid. We generally advise our guest to go with an extra mattress when there is more than one kid. The resort doesn't have the provision of baby cot at the moment.

Thank you once again for staying with us. Looking forward to your visit and assuring our best services at all times

"Good Covid Break","4","2020-08","2020-08-24","The review is based on Covid situation
Room: Booked a Classic double room. The room is spacious and clean.
Amenities: Apart from Children Play area nothing is open. There might be amenities but due to the Covid restrictions nothing is operational.
Service: They denied to carry my bag giving reason of Covid when I insisted they agreed to carry the big bag as I had a two year old baby.
Food: Hardly any options. Food is not good and very expensive. Spent 3.5K on two days food.
Surroundings: Nothing is available in the nearby vicinity. You have to travel 8+ kms for things.

Greetings from Jalmahal Resort.
We thank you for the feedback. Please note the present pandemic situation with restrictions has compelled us to minimize the services we provide.This applies to all indoor and outdoor activities,pool as well as to the restaurants to operate with limited menu options. Its a requirement for the guests to carry their own baggage during the covid situation, hence we update our guest to travel with minimum baggage.
On the sight seeing options, please note we are at the border of the city limits and most of the places are accessible within a radius of 8 to 10Km's.
We appreciate your rating of 4*, considering we are serving our guests at this difficult situation although its not feasible business wise  and involves greater challenges.

We thank you for patronizing us and look forward for your visit once the situation becomes normal

With Warm Rergads

"Pleasant.. could be better ","3","2020-02","2020-02-29","This place is placed off the main city but only as far as a twenty minute drive to the main locations of Mysore. 
Good
The food was great (both veg and non veg). The cook and the serving staff are very courteous and helpful. The surroundings are well kept and it is constantly echoing the chirpings of birds. There is also a great indoor play area but is left in explored by most guests. The eating units of the lawn restaurant is also very nice for a long meal.
Bad 
The major issues is with room cleanliness. Dirty towels, poorly maintained door knobs, and there was dead insects in the bathroom as we entered. From a customer experience standpoint the staff also does not look into small aspects like offering welcome drinks to customer, extra charges for baby meals, not providing even an extra bottle of water on check out day etc. The children’s park and the swimming pool can be better maintained. The kids activities are also few given that the rides and games are not working anymore.

It is such a good place but it can be much better with some attention to these details ","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r748265390-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452392144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","1200","1","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E1575GNjohnd","E1575GNjohnd","CD6314846F8BF2F0CD2F84CF96978CD7",,,,,"E1575GNjohnd",,"General Manager","749042983","en","2020-03-04","Jalmahal","Dear Guest

We will definitely  take the corrective measures to meet your expectations. Looking forward for your visit again

"Great place to spend with family!","5","2020-02","2020-02-23","We were two families with an 8 months old kid & stayed at this place for two days. Our initial choice was to go for executive rooms. But, we chose to switch to Classic ones while booking with MMT (thanks to Google/MMT reviews! Executive rooms are pretty small and only good if your are looking for a quick night stay). Resort premises with a lot of greenery offer fun time for kids and a refreshing break for adults. There were good number of indoor/outdoor activities which we couldn't explore much with our baby. Breakfast was sumptuous and filling. Staffs were very friendly (thanks to the lady staffs at restaurant, chef at live counter, room boy and reception staffs). Swimming pool was clean and very well maintained. Place is very family friendly and most of the guests we came across were families with kids. Guests are given a parting gift at the time of checkout containing couple of water bottles and snacks, a gesture very well appreciated.

Suggestions:
> Classic rooms in the ground floor doesn't have sitouts/balconies. We didn't know about it until we did check-in and we wish we were given rooms in first or second floor.
> Parking space is not good enough to accommodate a full booking day. So, if booking is for a long weekend, I would recommend to get early to the resort if you don't fancy having your car lying by the road. (Security staff did help us get a space to squeeze in our car when resort MD left, thanks to him)
> Carry swimming costumes. Pool staff is pretty strict about the rules. Worst case, you can get swimming clothes for rent.
> Ola/Uber services don't have coverage in the area of resort. So, you may want to sort out the outing plan accordingly.

Only con we came across:
> Resort premise is open for smoking. But, with so many kids around, I believe resort authority should contain the smoking to some smoking room or something. I wouldn't want my baby exposed to smoke while roaming around the premises. There is a pub area available, which may be dedicated for smoking as well.

Had a wonderful weekend! Would definitely prefer this place for another vacation!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r746998997-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","0","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arjunashok619","Arjun Ashok V","C90EBF98A3500C672D3B089463283449",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","arjunashok619",,"General Manager","747473932","en","2020-02-24","Jalmahal","Dear Guest,

This is the  only resort that does not have a hanging rod in the washroom. I booked the executive room. Room was fine, but pillows were hard as bricks. On request, I got them changed. The washroom was below par, and the entire room did not have a single door mat. When we were checking out, the receptionist was busy talking over the phone, and did not even bother to look at us, leave alone asking us to visit again. She just took the keys and said 'OK sir'!

"A very good budget hotel","4","2015-02","2015-02-16","This is one of the new hotels that have come up in Mysore in the recent times. 

Pros:

This hotel is right on the main road
A good budget hotel
Very clean
Good rooms
Clean toilets
Very close to all the attractions in Mysore
Above all - VERY HELPFUL AND KIND STAFF.

Cons:

The restaurant within the hotel is not good. 
No Privacy - All the room doors open up to a huge courtyard. People on the floors above you can see your bed directly from their walkway/balconies. 

Overall a great budget hotel.

The hotel is well situated reasonably near to the Palace and other attractions.

The room was clean and decently furnished, a plus point being a small safe for our valuables. The service was prompt and polite and the food was generally good and reasonably priced.

"Good hotel let down by the location of the room","3","2014-12","2014-12-29","I checked in to this hotel based on the reviews and ratings of tripadvisor.in and holidayiq.com. in fact, I already had done the bookings for the hotel the same day I checked in. But since the hotel did not receive any communications from he travel portal, the reception staff refused point blank, even after showing them the email confirmation from the travel website. I had to pay the day's rent as per the reception counter. 
Though the rooms was well layed out and cosy, space was a premium. 
The toilets were clean, though there were some spots in the bathe areas. 
Amenities were good for the hotel of its class.
Food quality was strictly average. 
The  worst part is the location of the room. The room was just next to the reception and there was a lot of noise.  Even after telling them that we are getting disturbed, there was no reduction in the noise levels. And this noise was done by the hotel staff! !

Would still rate them higher than kaveri palace though.

"Unseriöse Mitarbeiter","1","2014-11","2014-11-11","Die Reception bedient ebenfalls ein Touristic & Booking office, jedoch nur zu eigenen Gunsten. Wir wollten ein Zugbillet nach Udupi kaufen. Uns wurde mitgeteilt, dass es keinen direkten Zug gibt, wir sollen mit dem Bus reisen. Dies wollten wir nicht. Uns wurde danach mitgeteilt dass es einen Zug mit Umsteigen gibt aber nicht in den nächsten 4 Tagen, sei alles ausgebucht. Dies konnten wir fast nicht glauben und sind zum Busbahnhof gefahren. Und prompt, es gab einen Direktzug und zudem hatte es noch genügend freie Plätze. Uns wollte man einfach ein Busticket (möglicherweise von einem Freund von ihnen) verkaufen und so Provision kassieren.

Zweiter grob mangelhafter Vorfall: wir fragten in der Reception nach was ein Tuk Tuk in ein von uns gewünschtem Restaurant kostet. Er teilte ins mit 200 Rupee für ca. 4km. Der Mindestpreis liege bei 50 Rupee. Wie wir dann erfahren haben kostet diese Strecke maximal 80 Rupee und der Mindestpreis liegt bei 30 Rupee. Es stehen auch vor dem Hotel zahlreiche Personen und Tuk Tuk rum, die einen immer gröber über den Tisch ziehen wollen. Unserer Meinung nach glauben alle dort, dass weisse Reisenden viel Geld haben müssen.

Für uns kommt dieses Unseriöse Hotel nie mehr in Frage, wir sind sehr entäuscht!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r239425834-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391071","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","1200","1","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Huan199","Huan199","A682567F5C33EF9D9D91B8BF2632E940",,,,,"Huan199",,"Owner","241910555","en","2014-11-28","ragtan","Hai,  The Things What you are mentioned in the page is very usefull to us.

The staff is courteous & know exactly what is on the minds of customers (mysore-sight-seeing types). The place is strategically located & a traveler gets the 'feel' of Mysore town. All must-visit points are within close distance. 
Special mention- Due to continuous rains, it seems the laundry was not able to deliver fresh bath towels. When demanded, the staff purchased new set of bath towels and provided them promptly.

"Disappointed","2","2014-10","2014-10-07","No pick up or drop service provided, although committed in the hotel booking voucher.
The room provided for 3 persons, was of inadequate size and after placing the 3rd bed, movement inside the room became restricted. For the extra bed a blanket was provided but neither a cover nor a bottom sheet for the blanket was provided. We had to literally pray, cajole and finally fight for the cover.
A major safety issue is the positioning of the electric kettle inside the closed wooden cupboard. A major accident is just waiting to happen.
For payment against our extra days' stay the hotel initially refused to give any invoice and a proper receipt. They also insisted that, they would be accepting only cash payment. After a long heated discussion they provided me with a MMT statement of accounts signed and stamped by them, accompanied with a snide remark that this was the first time for them when a PAX has asked for a signed and stamped acknowledgement of payment.
Overall a sad experience.
P.S. The Restaurant offered a meager menu. But food was good and well prepared. However, they also insisted on cash payment for food served at Restaurant. 
Overall standard of cleanliness of rooms was good.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r233225382-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452386713","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","1200","19","38","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SUBIRDG","SUBIRDG","068D9A794714E86EA5B4EF0E17C66D8A",,"304558","Kolkata (Calcutta), India","Kolkata (Calcutta)","SUBIRDG",,"Front Office Manager","233562261","en","2014-10-09","ragtan","Dear sir,

"Never book in Treebo Golden Castle hotel, Mysore","1","2017-08","2017-08-29","This is totally dishonest hotel. With the same price you can get at least some 4 star hotel through Makemytrip.com. The service of Treebo is horrific and very low quality with the price range.
I had experience this in Treebo Golden Castle, Mysore last week. I cancelled my booking after staying one day there and with less price (around 1000), I booked a 4 star hotel in the heart of the city. Pathetic customer care, horrific receptionist, the facilities mentioned in the site is not true fully.
No bath tub but it is only show case in its web site. No clean environment. The main issue is behavior of the staff of this hotel. It is not deserving any star at all but I wonder how it got 3 star rating. 
Totally an unrealistic hotel. I think people who don’t have more time to search online or ignorance, are paying more and staying just like a normal hotel by paying comparatively very high price. Go with Trivago and search a better hotel with less price. Avoid this nonsense hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r518936027-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","276397163","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/79/7c/6b/sankar-b.jpg","50","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SankarB48","Sankar B","F27827C3D3A12EF2CEA79737C0A5AF85",,,,,"SankarB48",,"Guest Relations Manager","520131874","en","2017-08-31","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Small hotel with a big heart","4","2017-08","2017-08-09","We had a pleasant stay at Treebo Golden Castle for a couple of days. I was a little underwhelmed at the sight of it when we arrived, but the rooms were quite all right. The staff is warm and friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make your stay comfortable. As a budget hotel, I would rate it average on the price-value equation - but the location weighs in as you have quick and easy access to downtown Mysore and the touristy spots as well. They have parking space in the basement and just outside the hotel (which is where I parked my car - the security guard sits right there). The breakfast, frankly, is not great - with very limited variety. But the North Indian food we ordered (this is a veg only place - please note) for dinner was quite decent. Speak to the room service folks and they'll probably get you non-vegetarian food from a couple of places close by - although they officially maintain that food from other places is not allowed! Rooms are clean - except for some stains/spots on the wall tiles in the bath. I think they should follow a more stringent cleaning routine for the bathrooms. Go for it if you're there for a day or two and don't plan to spend too much time at the hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r510532431-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452389098","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1200","7","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eskaypist","eskaypist","3E4B47019D925D03FFC2D2E176937AF7",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","eskaypist",,"Guest Relations Manager","510851596","en","2017-08-10","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Mysore visit","1","2017-07","2017-07-25","I visited Mysore with my family. Hotel building is good and service is also good. But they have provide dirty bedsheets and pillows with dirty comforters. It is also not good that if you are in family with two kids than it's compulsory to purchase a extra bed. The breakfast provided was not good. They repeat the same items daily if it is veg Restaurent then they should provide more verities. 
No paratha chapati even no sweet and limited items without choice. I will never book with treebo if they will not maintain the class. We are paying for what?

"Excellent and Marvellous Hotel to Stay in Mysore with Neat Ambience!","5","2017-07","2017-07-24","I had booked this hotel all of sudden on Saturday early morning itself and was not sure about how the hotel would be and I was assured very much that the room will be reserved and I should really say that this was one of the best and neat and hygienic hotel in Mysore. After entering the hotel lobby I was mesmerised by the ambience and neat and hygienic surroundings. The reception staff was very friendly and received us with smiling face and took all our details within few minutes and handover the room keys to the boys.

Soon we went to our rooms allotted  in the 3rd floor and as soon as the room was opened I was surprised to see the kind of luxury kind of room within the budget cost it has got all the modern amenities i.e. starting from unlocking the door too switching on/off lights automatically. Hot water was available 24/7 both in the wash basin as well as in the shower too.

Regarding the room service boys or service they are one of the best and always smiling people who will take your request and explain you very much with patience and I liked their friendly atmosphere without expecting anything from return.

Overall my complete family including the kids enjoyed the stay here and I should once again say that this is seriously one of the best hotel to consider if you are planning for budget neat hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r505023387-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"553","299282460","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/d6/b0/1c/anands469.jpg","553","32","2053","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anandshivraj","anandshivraj","E3440246AECD0649ADCE7ECE960FC6E0",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","anandshivraj",,"Guest Relations Manager","506054129","en","2017-07-27","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Great location and good food, let down by pathetic customer service","2","2015-09","2015-10-04","I booked 3 rooms (did 3 separate bookings to take advantage of makemytrip's 50% discount coupon) for 6 adults and 2 kids (4 yr and 1 yr) for one night. Received confirmation emails from mmt for 3 rooms. The idea was to arrive there late evening and sleep to explore Mysore next day. We reached the hotel around 9pm after a great day at Shravanabelgola. Mr. Murali (if I recall the name correctly) was at the reception who broke the bad news that the hotel had only one room as they received only one request for one room from mmt. Usually I call the hotels/resorts in advance to ensure they have received the booking from mmt (mmt has great offers at times but their sense of customer service is absolutely pathetic and it became evident during this episode) but this time I couldn't do so as it was last minute plan. It wasn't Mr. Murali's fault but his lack of sensitivity to our situation (3 families with 2 young kids stranded at 9pm), his poor communication, his lack of command on what was happening around...it all left me baffled. He obviously had to deal with my wrath as I was already pissed off with what makemytrip did. This was mads worse by the fact that the entire hotel was sold out. Mr. Murali told us that his two other properties (viceroy and the president) were also sold out for that eventful night. Since we all were very tired and drained, we (8 of us) decided to settle in that one room and dine. We ordered food, it was great so no complaints there. We asked for 3 extra mattresses as the room was quite big (thankfully) and I wasn't sure what mmt would do to help me out at that hour. We were in for a surprise as there was no hot water supply in the room (we all wanted to take shower). When I called the reception, I was told that they stop it at 9pm. I lost it at this point and walked down to reception where Mr. Murali was present with his sorry again. As soon as I raised my voice, he said, ""sir, I would switch on the supply"". Isn't it amazing that he refused on phone, made me come down all the way to yell at him to start hot water supply? He could have just told the same to me on phone. Around 10:30pm, I called mmt customer care and blasted at the representative. I guess that wasn't really my night so l ran into a representative who had no sense of customer service. He uttered the formal nonsense he was probably trained to utter, without any sincerity in his tone. He told me that he would call the hotel and find out what went wrong. He did that and spoke with Mr. Murali in front of me. You can imagine what would have been the outcome when two people with no sense of customer service spoke to each other to help a customer out....bang on. The mmt's representative simply offered to cancel the two bookings (that was so nice of him to do that, right?) and made it clear to me that he couldn't do anything else to help 3 families with 2 kids who were left stranded in night by mmt. He said that mmt wouldn't pay for the cost of extra mattresses (so what if because of us eight of you had to sleep in one room, we are makemytrip...we can do anything we want and people would still come to us...I agree with that though). Finally I realized that it wasn't going anywhere and it was my fault (even if to make peace with myself) that I didn't call the hotel to ensure that mmt has passed the booking to them, which I always do. So I went back to THE room and crashed in the last remaining corner. Next day, I raised the issue (not of mmt's pathetic customer service but of Mr. Murali's apathy) with the GM who was a patient gentleman (he had to right). He heard me and apologized. I told him that they need to find someone else for reception as Mr. Murali wasn't even fit for room service, and there he was...the acting in charge of hotel in night. At least 3 other patrons yelled at him in front of me (tv wasn't on, ac wasn't working, etc.). The room was neat and large, food was good, the location is great...the good things. But the place is run like a pg with a warden who is more of a dictator. I hope it changes. But until then, big thumbs down to Mr. Viceroy as there is no Comfort here.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r316071607-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1024","181044023","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/ca/83/37/abhi2023.jpg","1024","56","47","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abhi2023","abhi2023","086E2AC87C826DDE7D2485515E32992C",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","abhi2023",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

"Best accommodation in Mysore for travelers with budget","4","2015-08","2015-09-09","We were in Mysore for business trip and after searching for some time decided  to choose this hotel. 
Manager Zaki is wonderful guy. He helped in getting the best room along with ease of shifting in. In room is service is something which is rarely seen, they are so flexible with timing and delivery. Dayaram, the guy looking after guest, is your go to guy for any request at any time - even in late night.
We had complementary breakfast and that's the best part of whole stay. Every day we had fresh breakfast which was delicious and well served.

"Decent Stay","4","2015-08","2015-08-29","My stay in a Premier Double Room at Viceroy Comforts with my wife and kid was quite decent. Checking in procedures were very simple and all the staff were extremely cordial. Room is very spacious and clean. The entire premises is kept neatly. Bathroom is a bit small but neat. The vast parking area is another commendable aspect. The location might seem to be a bit hard to find out for strangers but once you get there you will realize that it is right at the heart of the city and besides, the property can be easily located with the help of Google Maps. Major tourist destinations such as the Palace and zoo are so close to the hotel that it takes hardly a five minutes drive. Mall of Mysore also is near. They have a rooftop restaurant which serves only north Indian dishes. Food is a little overpriced and not so tasty. This would not be a problem as there are a couple of good vegetarian restaurants nearby. However, the view of the Chamundi Hills from the rooftop restaurant is superb. In a nutshell, Viceroy Comforts is  value for money and a place where you can surely spend your leisure hours with out any tensions.

"Worst ever hotel visited","1","2017-06","2017-06-28","This property seems to be new, but worst people, worst attitude, and worst facility.
Lift was not working and were bound to climb 3 floors with luggage.
Worst attitude of the staff. Big fight between the staff members at night 9:30 PM when people were waiting for their food.
Nobody was there to take order and serve food in the restaurant.
Even there was a old lady visitor in the hotel who fell down from the stairs, as the lift was not working
The food quality was poor.
I strongly recommend people NOT TO VISIT this hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r496799058-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452388586","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashishagrawal_2","ashishagrawal_2","F53BA64AB6DBD57D72CA857B0DD9AC6D",,,,,"ashishagrawal_2",,"Guest Relations Manager","498507200","en","2017-07-04","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

It has plenty of open space and greenery with some nice palace-type architecture. This also gives all the selfie and photo obessed folks a plenty of options. The area for outdoor games is good but the indoor play area needs adequate lighting and also a staff who can help you with the equipments. Now, the most important part - Restaurant, the vegetarian is pretty good but non-vegetarian is a disappointment.

"Not worth calling a resort. Strictly not recommended.","1","2018-12","2018-12-27","Restrooms and rooms were too small and unclean. None of the facilities were usable during our stay since they closed down all indoor games, cycling etc due to lack of staff. Rooms were too noisy since they play loud music for bonfire dinner just outside the room and create nuisance till midnight. Even after asking them to turn down the volume, I could not sleep the whole night. Everything is too costly. Just to rent a bicycle was 50/hour (That too limited time only till 5:30 PM). Most of their facilities dont operate after 5:30 PM (Cycling, Cricket, Indoor games, Swimming pool, etc). So basically you cannot do anything in the evening. Distance is far away from the city. Palace, Brindavan garden or any nearby restaurant is atleast 10-35 kilometers away. If you book for triple occupancy also they provide complimentary breakfast vouchers for only 2 people.

Breakfast in dining room was good, but again service dreadful.  We had a room on second floor at the front.

"Not to be fooled by its look!","2","2015-01","2015-02-08","Stayed here 2 nights, rooms booked by my travel agent. The only good thing that i can recall about this hotel is the cozy lobby and nothing else. Upon arriving checked with the receptionist on the temple timing but the information was wrong. 
We occupied 2 rooms and both were not clean, something the management need to look into. Only 2 very flat pillows provided and only 1 extra given upon request, for which the staff expected for tips (minutes upon arrival). Had issues with the hot water supply, you have to call them a few times and basically wait and wait, end up bathing in cold water.
Feeling hungry after checking in at about 3 pm, we went to their restaurant to be told there is only tea and bajji. The next morning breakfast was not ready on time despite confirming few times on their breakfast timing the day before, not even coffee or tea was ready. After waiting for half an hour, we came down to the lobby, lodged a complaint and then left with empty stomach as we had our list of places to visit.
We came back in the evening again just to find the rooms were not cleaned. Decided to leave this place as early as possible in the morning, we requested for a wake up call at 4 am but received nothing. We got ready to leave at 6 am and all the staff's were still sleeping in the lobby, only 1 of them bothered to wake up (now you know what happen to our wake up call)
Oh! There is Wi-fi connection, but you have to sit in their lobby.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r253150376-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"683","138748019","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/45/20/73/rugesh.jpg","683","69","95","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rugesh","Rugesh","9ED0A5A332DA42CCE26DBC2C8394B6C8",,"298570","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Kuala Lumpur","Rugesh",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

The pooris and noodles were oily and not served hot as well. Chutney is ok. Also the quantity kept is also less. There was no top up of the items, but the service people were waiting for us to finish fast so that they could clear the utensils fast. 
On the lunch and dinner menu, only chinese and north indian dishes are present. There was not South/North meals available. i.e., no simple items present on the menu(not even idli's), which are suitbale for kids. Rooms are of good quality, but could have been better for the price paid.(It was an AC deluxe room). Hot water in bathroom should be asked, otherwise they do not worry about switching ON the geyser.

"Comfortable Stay, Great Location","4","2014-10","2014-11-19","We - my wife & I - stayed for one night on 2nd October 2014. We had some difficulty in locating the Hotel due to poor directions given. But the location of the Hotel is very convenient since it is within walking distance from the palace. The room was large,clean and comfortable. The bathroom and toilet too were neat and clean. The staff is friendly and well mannered. It's certainly value for money. We ordered dinner in the room itself. The service was a mixed bag. Certain small items we asked took a long time but the dinner was served too quickly !

"Nice and Comfortable","4","2014-10","2014-10-10","We visited there during Dussera and trust me it was very difficult to get accommodation during that time. Coming to our stay, it was nice and comfortable, just what we need during a packed tour like ours. This hotel might not offer you best in class luxury but neither it disappoints you. Will try to summarize 

Positives:
Clean and Hygienic
Quick room service
Located very near to Palace and other tourist attractions
Ample parking place
Reasonable Tariff

Negatives:
Very limited breakfast buffet (tasty though)
No Fans so at times AC leaves you too cold
No WiFi in rooms

"Great for a short stay !","5","2017-05","2017-06-08","Amazing hotel, by all parameters: proximity to tourist places, the Railway Station, Bus Station and what's more, if you're driving, its on the main road. Ample parking (as a person who drives a lot in Bengaluru, this is of paramount importance). The rooms are well appointed and maintained. The staff (as with most Mysoreans) are very courteous and helpful. The in-house restaurant can be improved (have told the management so) but when there are so many options for street food and the fact that we were out most of the day, i wouldn't harp on this a lot. 

Don't forget to ask the staff to take you out on to the terrace at night. Amazing view and if you're staying there overnight on a Sunday ... don't miss seeing the Mysore Palace lit ... its a sight to behold!

All in all, had an amazing weekend trip, walked everywhere and loved the place.

"Luxury hotel that's also pocket friendly","4","2017-05","2017-06-04","We stayed at Treebo Golden Castle from 29th - 31st May 2017. This hotel sits bang on main road of Mysore yet the surroundings are not crowded. Market from here is 10 minutes walkable. Famous Mysore palace is 10 minutes drive. Railway station is nearby. Almost every sightseeing or shopping place is 10 minutes drive.  That's the plus point !
We had opted for delux rooms, which are quite specious, cozy and clean. It had mini refrigerator, electric kettle & all necessary toiletries. Standard rooms are less specious though. Still those are good for couples. 
They have pure veg restaurant. Food quality was good but they offered limited number of items in their complimentary breakfast. 
Staff is courteous. People at reception are always ready to help for any kind of need. Whether its shopping, travelling or any other need. They also have in-house travel desk which offers packaged sightseeing tours.  
All in all very nice place to stay at reasonable rates.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r490336493-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","123700907","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/5f/86/ab/girinath-b.jpg","50","1","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GirinathBharade","GirinathBharade","B80FED0165C14FF82D2029096BE6AF29",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","GirinathBharade",,"Guest Relations Manager","490605695","en","2017-06-05","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Wonderful Stay","4","2017-05","2017-05-24","It’s a very good hotel and situated quite close to palace and zoo. The hotel is nicely built, the rooms are big with AC, chair, table, 32” TV, complimentary tea/ copy, electric kettle….. You can directly book through hotel too and at times they offer some discount and you might get it cheaper than Cleartrip or so. Stay was wonderful. 
The only problem was the restaurant. They have outsourced it and hence have less control on it. The food was good in restaurant and rates too. The quantity was little less maybe that’s why the prices seemed reasonable. The order time was high, around 20 min or so. Meager staff to handle the crowd. We were on the working day, I don’t know how they manage on weekends. Next day was worst. The breakfast was suppose to start at 7.30 and many occupants came down to have it and start the journey/ tour. We couldn’t understand the delay reason as it was difficult to communicate due to non-hindi speaking staff. Later on we understood that the main receptionist and the serving staff was not available though the food was more or less ready. One of the customer took lead and started serving the food too and quickly people could have food and move on.

"Nothing more of a AC lodge","2","2017-05","2017-05-23","I doubt to say this to be a hotel. Have your expectation set before you book this place, if you are looking for just an AC room it can be your choice.
My experience - 
Room - 
Average size room size, bathroom was spacious, both were clean.
AC (functional in my case :) )
Dirty bed sheet and blanket and worn out linen on runner and cushion cover.
Faulty water kettle.
TV with satellite TV connection.
VLCC toiletries ( shampoo, soap and moisturizer)
Wifi is pathetic.

Staff ( some ) was polite, but be sure to get fake promises.
They don't own a restaurant and seems its a third party that owns it. B'fast was of very limited variety with OK quality food, not good not bad. You won't get lunch or dinner.

Travel desk is pathetic. 

Customer service and needs a lot improvement.

I just spent a transit night and thanks it was only one. On top of all these they ask (charge) 1% if you make payment by card. In my case, I insisted and they rolled it off.

Based on my exp. I do not suggest this or will make any future plans.

Things that were bad are:
- the phone in the room did not work...could not even call the reception or room service
- food was not great, the buffet spread was poor though the quality of food was not bad
- the staff need to be trained on how to speak to customers as one of the ladies in the reception was literally trying to chase us away saying they need the room for the next guest, though we had agreed on a time for vacating
- the freebees in the toilet like shampoo / conditioner appear used (half filled)
- there was no door mat outside the bathroom thus leaving little puddles of water ever time somebody stepped into a bath and came out
- The window in the room opened on to a large marriage hall and therefore the din of the music was terrible, though my little daughter enjoyed the evening's party.

"Avoid at all costs","1","2014-05","2014-06-17","We checked into this hotel on 2nd May after a tiring journey. We were told the room is ready for us. But on entering, we found that it was far from that. We could not get fresh because there were no towels inside the bathroom. We had to wait for 20 mins for that. That night there were heavy sufrains in Mysore due to which some power cable got cut. It was understandable. However, they did not have alternative arrangement for power. Two hours later power was restored in some of the rooms and ours was not restored. We requested them to provide an emergency light or atleast a candle but they refused. The lifts also were not working. We had dinner in the restaurant upstairs which was terrible. Before leaving, we checked with the restaurant manager when would the power be restored completely. A waiter chipped in and said that we could sit in the rest rooms inside the rooms as there is a back up bulb over there!!! We were taken aback and told them we did not pay to come and sit in rest rooms . When I complained to the general manager, he spoke very rudely and defended his staff's behaviour and slammed the phone. The situation did not improve for the next two days as well. The lift was not operational. No power inside the room, no AC, no internet nothing. We had gone with our 2.5 year old daughter. She was getting scared of sitting in the darkness.  Our request to change the room was also turned down. We were too happy to check out on 4th May but again we received our last dose. Hot water was not avaialble in the bathrooms and they kept telling that they are working on it. After waiting till 11.30, we checked out finally. We demamded a refund as we hardly got any facilities we were promised but the general manager refused telling that they had spent for 50000 rupees on replacing the genset and no discount can be given. Our sincere Advice for anyone booking here , better stay on roadside hotels of Mysore which I think would be much cleaner and serviced better compared to this .","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r210697927-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,,,,,"6","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkhilaM22","AkhilaM22","CEC1287759DB756644466F20E61EFB2C",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","AkhilaM22",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

"Avoid Viceroy Comforts","1","2014-02","2014-02-11","I would give this hotel a zero rating, but it's not possible. The hotel is very bad in quality. Rooms had a bad smell and we had to ask for hot water to be turned on. Internet was available, but didn't work at all, despite many complaints.

Complimentary Breakfast was very poor and unhygienic, having found ants on the loaf of bread. Waiters were decent, but took very long to serve hot tea. Selections of food was very limited, and they didn't even bother to refill cereal. 

While staying at the Viceroy hotel, we only ran into one other couple staying there. The hotel was a ghost town, and for good reason.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r193758112-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg","1200","2","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/302nirajs","Niraj S","1930599FA42CC734C4086F7EFEB73060",,"528820","Wembley, United Kingdom","Wembley","302nirajs",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"
"Good Interior","4","2013-11","2014-01-31","This hotel is located at calm area, but still near the Mysore Palace and other tourist places in the city. Seems to be have been newly built, good for people prefering to stay in hotel with modern interiors. Good courteous Staff. Nice value for money buffet breakfast. One more reason for me to choose this hotel was that its restaurant is pure veg.

"Average budget hotel","3","2014-06","2014-06-17","This was my 2nd trip to mysore and I chose same hotel based on my last experience. I booked 2 non ac rooms again. Here are few pros and cons of this hotel.

Pros:
Nice location: You are just close to palace and in the centre of the town. Infact, if you love walking, you can actually walk around to zoo (2 km away), palace (800m away) etc. There are good eateries around this hotel.
Cost: Its a budget hotel with 900INR for non AC room.

Cons:
1) As I experienced last time, the mattress were of very bad quality and the bed ws too small. So, if you have small kid which will sleep in between, there is good chance that you can fall off from bed edge (because mattress stuff just drops down on edges). And no kidding, I did fall once :)
2) Don't avail food services of the hotel. The food is not at all tasty. In fact, I overheard another traveller complaining about stale food (She probably ordered north indian Aloo Bhaji).
3) Parking: Now this is worst part. They have small parking and normally your car is blocked by any car. Now they don't keep keys with them. They will come to your room and will take the keys to adjust your car so that other car can come out. And if the car owner is not in hotel and taking stroll outside, you are blocked. I waited twice like that. The management should mandatorily keep keys for all the cars there.

Bottomline: Good location. Cheap hotel. Eat food outside. Have fun. Mysore is beautiful.

ps: Last time, I guess I gave better rating to this hotel but they have not improved on mattress quality (they did comment that they will do it). Its been exactly an year and nothings changed. In fact, last year when they didn't have restaurant and they were getting it from outside vendor, food was much better.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r210728715-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"412","28787171","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b7/41/e3/ankit-kakkar.jpg","550","38","94","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/contactkakkar","Ankit Kakkar","523F723CFD5BC6B014181C9F73D7B213",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","contactkakkar",,"Owner","558930160","en","2018-02-06","ragtan","Dear Sir,

"Clean but noisy. ","2","2014-05","2014-05-09","When i arrived at Kings Kastle the hotel was crowded with familys with small children.  They made a terrible noice day and night. At the restaurant at top ofta the hotel it was total chaos. Small children running around the tables.  It is not nice to sit next to a table where a boy had wet his pants and the parents cleaned him at the table.  
The entrance to the hotel is through a garage. That made noice to the rooms and smell from the engines.  
The room was ok, but dark without natural light.  
Wifi was working very slow.  
The staff was friendly and service minded. Location is good central in Mysore. 
The hotel is non smoking, and i accept that,  but the place i was shown to smoke was the gentlemens toilet beside the restaurant. It have been possible to arrange some smokers place at the roof top. 
The restaurant lokked like an old railway station from Sovjet. Needs redecoration.  
If i come back to Mysore Kings Kastle will not be my choise.

"Inexpensive for what you get, but noisy","3","2014-01","2014-04-11","OVERVIEW

Kings Kastle was in a relatively convenient neighbourhood near the palace, although surrounding shops were useless for the usual traveller consumables (toothpaste, tissue etc). It would be a reasonably good choice for the money — if they could deal with the night time noise factor. Excepting traffic noise, this was the noisiest hotel in 5 months of Asian travel.

Check-in / Check-out : PASS
Entrance / Perimeter security : PASS
Restaurant : PASS (for breakfast)

ROOM

Room door security : PASS
Room window security : PASS
Other room security (safe etc.) : N/A
WiFi : PASS
Fan or A/C : PASS
Lighting : PASS
Electric sockets : FAIL. Sockets in the room were okay, but there was a wall socket with a broken face plate inside the bathroom near the shower. This is an electrical short waiting to happen.
Closet / wardrobe : PASS
Natural light : LIMITED due to window facing into the interior courtyard
Window coverings : PASS
TV and programming : PASS
General cleanliness : PASS

BED

Bed mattress quality : PASS
Bed linens quality and cleanliness : FAIL — seemed to have been slept in. Had them changed and still used hostel liners because pillow cases did not seem clean.
Pillow quantity and quality : FAIL 2 flat pillows on double with unclean pillow cases
Mosquito net : N/A

BATHROOM

Cleanliness : PASS
Bathroom cold water : PASS, although sink leaked a small amount
Bathroom hot water : PASS
Bathroom drainage : PASS, although the entire bathroom floor gets swamped taking a shower

OVERALL

Sleep quality : FAIL, due to incessant noise both nights. Dragging furniture upstairs until midnight. Loud voices in the 'echo-chamber' carpark in the courtyard until 2 a.m. Appeals to Reception did not solve the problem. Even in day time, the temple across the street puts speakers out on the sidewalk and blasts music right into the 'echo chamber'.
Value for money : PASS (sleep quality notwithstanding)
Would we use this lodge again? NO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r200696796-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1561","90255027","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/61/2e/b3/latetothestation.jpg","1559","95","106","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latetothestation","latetothestation","C19050A729E0E698A7DBDD6A596EF67B",,"154945","Victoria, Canada","Victoria","latetothestation",,"Owner","558930456","en","2018-02-06","ragtan","Dear Guest,

That is noise extends through all building. In hotel it is a lot of baits of type of blinking bulbs and transparent lift. We saw the whole families which sat and admired all it. Certainly, they probably has had the luck to book the cheapest rooms :-)

"Average hotel with decent amenities","3","2017-12","2018-01-06","This Resort is located on the outskirts of Mysore & little far from the city(9KMs to Mysore Palace). The hotel is in a calm & isolated location with no development for 3 KM radius, this place would suit for people who have their own vehicle for going around or travelers need to hire a cab through the hotel.  The check-in experience was OK. The rooms are relatively bigger with all the basic amenities you expect from a typical 3 star hotel. There is scope to improve on the cleanliness because though the room looked spacious, it had a very distinct odour (Kind of a unpleasant smell due to dampness). This hotel has got just one restaurant & a small Bar facing the swimming pool. Breakfast spread was limited with an average taste/quality. The ala-carte food seemed to taste much better than the food served in the Dinner or BreakFast Buffet. You don't have much of a choice for food given that you should travel at least 10 KMs to find alternate eating options. They do have a small indoor play area(Snooker, Foos ball, Table tennis, Carom etc). For outdoor sports, they have a small children's play area(swing etc..) & cricket net practice area in the parking. This hotel has a decent sized swimming pool but I didn't like the smell of the water in the pool. Kids pool is closed now for unknown reasons. This is a small resort so you don't get much to do inside the resort. The staffs are courteous but not very professional. Many of them don't understand/speak English. If the hotel management addresses some of the main concerns mentioned in this review, I am sure this hotel will become one of the worthwhile places to stay in Mysore for travelers but for now its a long way to go.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d7291214-r552055003-Jal_Mahal_Resort_Spa-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452388669","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","1200","35","59","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/venkatkrish78","venkatkrish78","5A8E816FDA95158FEA33976B0D2D729C",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","venkatkrish78",,"Front Office Manager","695355829","en","2019-08-03","Discover789658","Greetings from JAL MAHAL RESORT & SPA,Mysore !!!

"absolute gem with a pocket friendly tag","5","2017-11","2017-12-05","This is an absolute gem with a pocket friendly tag. With Mysore Palace being just a fifteen minute drive, this resort has it all.

If you like the feeling of being amidst natural beauty then this place will certainly not disappoint you. The walk way to the lobby / reception is beautiful and covered with sheltering trees. The rooms are clean, spacious and have a traditional touch with all the modern features that one could ask for. 

The outdoor dining is worth the mention too. Several small covered seating arrangements amidst the garden make this a rather cozy place to have a candle light dinner. 
The food is of good standard and the portions suit the price you pay.

Other amenities such as swimming pool, game area with the options of table tennis, fussball table, snooker, badminton, gym etc. There is also a separate area with slides, swings etc for children. 

There is also the option for a full fledged bar for those looking to sip it up.

The Spa service has been shut so a relaxing massage is not on the cards. I guess it would be fair to say that the greenery will certainly have a refreshing effect on your mind and body.

The room service and housekeeping department do justice every bit.

Overall I highly recommend Jal Mahal to those looking for a quick get away from the city life just to chill. Please keep in mind that having a vehicle is recommended. Not too sure if there are sufficient cab services available at Mysore.

Keep up the hospitality.

"Average","3","2017-11","2017-11-26","To begin with, the resort is quite far from city and absolutely nothing around for good 2-3 kms. No OLA / UBER will come as it's out of range and it's a pain if u don't take ur own vehicle. The local taxis create a fuss to get there cos of the placement and distance.  Also, the food is very highly priced and of avg quality. Buffet tastes good only on Sunday, o ther days it's below avg, cos u guessed it right, low crowd. The mattress is of weird quality. It's very slippery on edges and I almost fell twice from bed while sleeping.  Hot water goes off and nobody cares to fix it. Tap in washroom was stuck and unable to operate, they didn't care to fix it. Purely money minded. As simple as it.  They don't even give complementary news paper. They insist on nylon costume in swimming pool to sell their swimwear.  Also they forced us to pay for a broken water glass which we didn't even touch.
Though it's serene and peaceful, it's quite small place.  Better go to something where the accessibility is good.

"Budget hotel","3","2017-05","2017-05-17","A decent and clean budget hotel close to Mysore junction which is suitable for a short business trip. The Front desk lady was very courteous and kind enough to give us early check in when we landed with our kids. The rooms are just adequate with basic amenities. The Wifi hardly worked even after connecting.
The worst experience was with the food in the restaurant Mysore Mallige. The restaurant is outsourced to a local caterer who runs it like a roadside eatery. The plates were actually dirty, the complimentary breakfast was limited to 3 dishes which were served in the most un-appetising manner. My children survived on bread which we bought from outside.

"TREEBO....The BEST.....Budget Hotel, with satisfaction............","5","2017-05","2017-05-15","May 2017- Booking for three days was done over phone and it was really in our budget and with all amenities and complementary breakfast and Free Wi-Fi. 

The great thing is that Treebo has not even taken any advance payment for the booking. Just two days before they have requested a miss call through SMS ...for confirmation, and that's it... You are Confirmed Checked- IN.

Location - its very prominent and on the main road, thus no problem of searching or parking, cellar parking is also available.

Room - was really sufficient for all out family members.

Cleanness - it was done daily and up to our satisfaction.

Staff -  They are really caring and courteous.

Tea/Coffee -  They have kept electric Kettle for self service.... and they do not mind providing you any number of tea sachets.

"Nice hotel","4","2012-12","2013-11-21","Though our stay was very small (1 Nt), it was good experience.
The rooms wer very good, I had family room which has ample space with 4 beds. The tariff is affordable. Hotel has its own restautent with good quality of food. staff is very friendly. Locating the hotel is bit difficult as it a part of one of the convention hall, and few people know by name of hotel, infact they know by the name of convention hall.
I'll recommend this hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r185455413-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"960","344140049","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/83/29/11/milindtendulkar.jpg","960","79","325","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilindTendulkar","Milind Tendulkar","7F4DA006A9D6B9E11E45AFC78D4A2771",,"297654","Pune, India","Pune","MilindTendulkar",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

 Since i had booked through makemytrip.com hotel did not give me bill too which was my right to get and said they may give me scan copy once make my trip will settle the bill. I informed hotel that i need original bill but hotel said they will check after 2 days.
This hotel has given very terrible experience.

"More than Expectation..Value for money","4","2013-05","2013-06-02","I booked this hotel at the last minute through make my trip site on last minute booking deal. I am very much satisfied with the hotel and would love staying in this hotel anytime in future when I visit mysore. There are few reasons which made me like this hotel. I am listing down for your benefit. Anyplace if you visit by your own car the first thing you would look out for is a safe parking space for your car. Just before booking this hotel, I called them and enquired about the parking facilities there, I got a reply from them that they have an ACRE space to park the cars. I thought they were kidding but its true, The car parking space was awesome, 100 or even more cars can be parked at a time there. Then , on the checkin. Since I booked this hotel from chennai and then started to mysore right away, I reached the place only by 1am Midnight. This place is situated right in the heart of mysore , just a km away from the mysore palace. The hotel reception person ( donno his name ) was kind enough to guide me the route to hotel and also made a smooth and quick checkin process as we were already tired after travelling the whole day. The lifts were very good and the entire facility was clean. We were offered a room at level 2. After seeing the ambiance, we were expecting the rooms to be neat and we are NOT disappointed in it. Rooms were lot spacious and neat. Bathrooms were good too with all basic needs kept right there in perfectly packed state. A nice running Split A/c and a LCD tv is more than enough for a room. They had them both and in addition the rooms had a small sofa arrangement along with writing table chairs and coffee maker / Hot water kettle which helped us prepare hot water for our kid. Morning buffet was provided for us complimentary. There is a scope of improvement here on the varieties they serve. The quality was good but variety could have had some more to that. Basic bread varieties , corn flakes , south indian specials , a fruit and hot beverages would be there. Fair enough. The hotel provided free Wifi access too but restricted to hotel lobby alone. I had plans to proceed further to coorg for which I had to make the last minute booking for which I needed internet facility. I used the wifi in lobby and did the booking. At times, wifi connectivity was throwing error, but the manager was kind enough to resolve it at the earliest. Overall, I am much satisfied with this hotel and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who doesn't wish to make a mess out of their trip.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r162706333-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"2736","67301327","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/02/ef/cf/nmuthu26.jpg","3648","3","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmuthu26","Muthukumar N","425D4A21C29BB84DECBD5E929B1EFF7B",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","nmuthu26",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"
"comparatively ok hotel","3","2013-05","2013-06-01","i booked online with hotel directly believing that becaz they had 3 hotels in mysore, it would be professional group. but to my surprise it was not so. thought property was good newly built up and cleanliness or rooms-balccony-restaurent is good but staff is very less, also one manager mr kazi khan is little good otherwise receptionist etc are average. Breakfast they serves complimentary but its just bread butter-toast and tea coffee and 1 hot breakfast, not exiting one. even corn-flex they did not have chocos which are favourite of kids. We in advance requested for jain food for our breakfast, however whenever we went in restaurent and requested there, people there always look @ us and say its not possible than we had to use hard language with them. A Very bad kind of experience.

Cable TV in the Room serves very few channels mostly in regional languages of south, so again BAD Experience.

It seems that management did not have control over the hotel nor they care.

"Decent place.","3","2013-05","2013-05-21","Although the name and appearance of this place is imposing but facts lies somewhere else. The name of this place gives you a feeling as if this is an erstwhile palace coverted into a heritage hotel but it is not the case. As you enter the premises you get a feeling that this is a star hotel coz of the sheer amount of its parking space and the main facade. But when you realise that the main facade is a multipurpose hall and not a part of the hotel and the huge parking space is for the functions that are held in that hall your enthusiasm about this place evaporates.

Actually this hotel is not bad in itself. Pluses being proximity to the tourists attractions biggest of them being Mysore Palace. The rooms are spacious but lack ventilation. If you happen to open your windows there is hospital next to it and there are chances of fowl smell emanating from it. The rooms are AC by that I mean they only have ACs and no fans so just in case u r feeling the chill and want to switch of the AC you cant do that coz there is no chance of ventilation.

Beds are big, clean and comfy matresses. Clean sheets and towels. Pretty decent toileteries in the bathroomm. It has one restaurant and its pure veg. Breakfast menu although repetetive is good. Room service is prompt. Check in & Check Out was swift.

All in all a decent place to stay in Mysore.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d2325174-r161365802-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","2","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AASawant","AASawant","94F1BDB2EC83A43499FC42E40579695A",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","AASawant",,,,,,,,"770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira, Mysuru (Mysore) 570 004 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570 004","Karnataka","770/5, F-25, Ramanuja Road","Annex Rajendra Kalamandhira","2325174","12.292374","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.652885","The Viceroy Comforts","144","3.3","17","19","28","57","23","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d2325174-Reviews-The_Viceroy_Comforts-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.rpsshotels.com"

"Ok Stay, not too far from important locations, maybe overpriced","3","2012-12","2012-12-29","Stay was good and quite close to Palace and the zoo. However breakfast was too limited,  and rooms overpriced. There's no mineral water in the room either.

The only saving grace was the Front Office Manager/Executive - a lady, who tried her best to do most for us.

The rooms are a bit small but good enough if your plan is to go around sightseeing. The food served is very good through variety is limited. 

The best feature of the hotel is the staff who are cordial, helpful and accommodating. We had a slight issue of overstay which was taken care by the manager in an amicable manner. Everybody else in the place, from the security to the bell boy had a smile on their faces at all times.

This hotel has an acute problem of bed bugs.And the management was reluctant to listen. The rooms are small and cramped. All the rooms face central parking. Vehicles keep moving in/out the entire night and early morning. Because of the closed space you can hear drunk guests talking loud over phone and loud televisions till late night. It was overall pathetic experience. It ruined our entire stay. It was a family stay had the misfortune of using three rooms in the same hotel. And unfortunately all the rooms had bed -bugs. Please do not ever go close to this hotel if you do not want to trouble your family. The manager Mr Bhat is an weirdo who does not listen to your complaints and he does not care if you are comfortable or not.

"Noisy and rude ripoff","2","2014-01","2014-01-17","My wife and I stayed there for 2 days.
+: in the centre of the city, hair dryer, decent service in the restaurant;
-: noisy, rude in making you pay extra, terrible laundry service.

The rooms are around an inner court topped by a roof, which serves also as a garage. There is a wide exit to the busy street, so the thing is like an echo chamber. The windows are towards this lobby-garage, so there is no use of them.

Both in the reservation e-mail and when checking-in, I asked for a quiet room with AC. Although the answer was positive, we were offered a room where noise came in through the door (from the lobby-garage) and through the bathroom window (from the outside traffic). Asked for another one and were given one with no bathroom window (so noise just through the door) and no AC. When checking-out, I was asked to pay the original AC tariff and a dinner was not included. I told the 2 ladies that we never had the AC room, but they said it was not possible to change the room type in their system. Then why did they even offer me a non-AC room? When I mentioned also the dinner that was missing, they called the restaurant and confirmed it, added the 550 INR and 'applied a discount of 200 INR for the AC'. Just that the tariff discrepancy, on their website, between AC and non-AC, is 399 INR / day, which would mean 798 INR for 2 days, rather than their 200 INR discount.

As for their laundry service, it was fast, but we got blood-like, grease-like and white stains on our clothes.

Don't expect to get any sleep, it's just too noisy.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r191161107-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"2448","88231313","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/42/4d/91/liviu-s.jpg","3264","12","19","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477livius","Liviu S","3E594B4E0A0DFCB21D0F2355639F67C5",,"294458","Bucharest, Romania","Bucharest","477livius",,"Front Office Manager","191294698","en","2014-01-18","ragtan","Dear Guest,

We thank you for sparing the time to post your review of our hotel which goes a long way in maintaining and improving our hotel standards and services.

Regarding the issue raised by you, i would like to clarify that without a proper booking voucher on hand, these kind of issues do occur. Kindly always carry a voucher for reference so that it can ease the process for you as well as us. Also, in all portals they have mentioned the customer must carry a valid ID proof of the guest and his partner;Hence their was an issue b'coz you were not having an valid ID proof.

As part of our improvement plan, we have introduced our own multi cuisine restaurant on roof top.

P.S: We would like to suggest you to check the guest voucher and terms and conditions of the voucher to avoid any confusions, which otherwise could have been avoided.
 
Look forward to welcoming you back to Hotel Kings Kastle on your next visit.

"A Good Budget Hotel","4","2013-12","2014-01-06","We had planned a day trip in Mysore and booked this place as a budget option. I did not have high expectations from this place, but I was not at all disappointed.
This Hotel is located on the main road and near to Mysore Palace and Zoo. The place and rooms were clean and had all the basic amenities. 
They also have a restaurant which served good food, initially I was reluctant to have my lunch here, but ended up having my dinner here too. The food was really good, however I felt that the quantity was not justified for the price charged. I would also request to start serving proper atta chappatis.
This hotel is a collectable of Chinese products, LED lights, Electric Kettle, Door Locks, Electric Safe, etc. They had Electric Kettle in the rooms with Tea & Coffee making kit provided complimentary. 
I would also suggest them to improve on their bedding, the mattress was loaded with springs, It would have been better if they have a coir or some other mattress that provides more comfort.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r189951211-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","106320656","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/56/53/10/am-the-game.jpg","50","24","99","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Am-The-Game","Am-The-Game","D749116FDE77B854BB9DA7D7A6D4976C",,"294265","Singapore, Singapore","Singapore","Am-The-Game",,"Front Office Manager","190357046","en","2014-01-09","ragtan","Dear Guest,

"A good hotel to stay in Mysore","4","2013-11","2013-11-17","With its location in almost the centre of most of Mysore's attractions it is in a well placed location.
St.Philomena's church, Mysore palace, Mysore zoo, n a few more attractions are well within 3-5 kms of this hotel.
With a night's stay at Rs. 2800 for a a/c 4 bed room, it was at a good price as well.
The staff including the manager was quite friendly and assisted whenever we needed some help.
The food at the restaurant was good and would have got a thumbs up from me but for its delayed serving time. We once had to wait for more than an hour in our room for our food even when there is an extra 10% for room service.
Apart from this the only other con was lack of sufficient parking space for cars.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r184982870-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452389492","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","1200","6","20","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/santripadv","Sanjay S","A4F233AA7803BC4C2A76E1D9F1BF90B3",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","santripadv",,"Front Office Manager","185650957","en","2013-11-23","ragtan","Dear Guest,

The locality of the hotel is also very good.

"Decent Budget Hotel","3","2013-10","2013-10-15","This hotel is in the heart of city. I stayed there from 2 Oct to 4 Oct 2013. Intercom phone never worked during that time. We stayed at room 207 at first floor. It was 3 bed room (we were 3 adults & my 4 years daughter) Room was precious enough considering this as budget hotel.  Hot water was available for 24 hours. They should improve lighting system in toilet.
Hotel does not have its own restaurant. Talking about room service, we ordered only milk but quality was not good. So we preferred to eat outside. 

Staff at reception was polite and they allowed extra time for check out. They have 24 hours check out. 

You can see Mysore palace lighting on Sunday and on all holidays at ~7:30 pm. During that time roads towards palace are crowed.  In such conditions it is better to book hotel near to the palace.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r181105777-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","16","25","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prayog","Prayog","8E2EECDDAE33C3BBEBD5D45C446E028F",,,,,"Prayog",,"Front Office Manager","184236489","en","2013-11-10","ragtan","Dear Guest,

Cons.
1. Property is not maintained properly. We were actually staying on 1st floor, but as soon as we entered room and started fan, there was a spark, so was bit a scary, later we were shifted to AC room, which was good for us..but initially i thought of changing hotel.

We complained, they fixed it but took 1 hour to fix. There service was bad, some times they forgot that I asked them to send water bottles. I stayed there for two days and they never came for room cleaning except when we checked in, I have to ask for tea bag, milk powder etc. Wifi was too slow on the first day.

On the plus side the bathrooms were clean. They have a mini fridge and a safe locker, but the sheets are worn out and have holes in them.
In the night was woken up by small creatures running on the bed. I had to check out early morning and had specifically instructed the security about it.

I would avoid the rooms on the ground floor as they did not look very secure - the courtyard is open to the street although there is a security guard at all times.

"Value for money","5","2013-07","2013-07-24","I stayed at this place on July 21-22. First, the hotel has a 24 hour check out policy. So you dont end up paying for the second day if you check in late on the first day. Second, it is centrally located, near the KSRTC bus stand (sub urban bus stand), a 5-6 minute walk from it. Railway station would be a bit longer, but Rs. 30 in an auto rickshaw. Third, rooms are very clean, decor done up well, with even mood lightings ! fourth, toilets are very clean, with running hot water promised. The toilet seats were also sanitised. But... (1) windows face the passage / courtyard, and there is no other ventilation. (2) They have room service, but they get the food from some other place. And food was not all that great.

Apart from that, it was a value for money. Definitely would stay here if I visited Mysore again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r168939535-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"412","42613433","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/8a/3a/b9/ramansvinu.jpg","550","165","409","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramansvinu","Vinod","360F6BC6BBC4813535107C837B260509",,,,,"ramansvinu",,"Manager","171678759","en","2013-08-10","ragtan","Thanks for your feedback.

"claim high , serve poor","2","2012-05","2012-05-24","As a family we got 3 premier double rooms  and stayed between 19 to 21st may 2012.  First experience itself was a bad experience as they have not provided any towels. When called house keeping no one picked up the call. called up reception 3 times then they send a room boy with small hand towels ans telling us that they do not have stock of towels and would be available at 4 30 pm. one of the rooms, AC was not working and we had to call 3 times to register the complaint. AC problem was not attended till 9.30 pm on that night and when we went down to reception, they were cool in saying that fans will be provided and asked  us to take up with manager next day morning. Refused to even change the the room. It  was a horrible night as it was very hot day and it really spoilt the mood. other miscerys are
1. Drinking water was served only after 1 hr  15 mins after the request was made 3 times.
2 provided the same menu of lunch as the dinner and even though alcarte was available, refused to provide. when took up, reply was it was their std.
3 in one of the rooms ,  main door latch was not lockable and had to keep the doors just closed and managed the night
4. In the same room, water tap handle comes out easily
5 In the same room,  there was a door which connects to next  room and   they  are so careless the ydid not even bother to lock it and by accident we came to know that.
6. Hot water is not availble for bath after 10 am
7.No information leaflet/ broachure in the room 
etc.etc. etc.

The rooms in this hotel are comfortably large, but that is about the only good thing here. There is a marriage hall in the same complex which makes the surrounding pretty noisy and busy. The worst part is the the break fast buffet. They don't serve on time and run out of food. Several items are simply not served when they have less customers in the hotel. 

The employees are indifferent about customers' complaints and the owner was missing! We also encountered mosquitoes in the corridors and in the room.

"Very comfortable stay & value for money...","4","2011-09","2012-01-05","We stayed in Viceroy comforts for 3 nights. It is a value for money hotel. Pretty neat and clean. We had taken deluxe rooms which were very spacious and well decorated. The bathrooms were clean and had most of the modern ameities. Room service was also upto the mark. The only disappointing aspect was the COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST which had very little options. The normal idly, dosas and plain bread(no toaster available). 

We went in September 2011. They didnt have any kitchen back at that time and got their food from of of their sister concern hotel. There are lot of other restaurants in the vicinity, so food is not a problem. They have a room service menu with most of the options. The portions are good and the price is above average

The hotel staff were cordial and cheerful led by Ms Anusha Aradhya at the reception. The location is not in the heart of the city but other parts of the city is easily accesible from the hotel.

"Good hotel but badly managed","4","2017-04","2017-05-04","Good spacious n clean rooms. Easily located from the road. Close proximity to rly stn n bus stand. Hotel does not offer buffet breakfast and have to chose 2 dishes out of the given as a result a lot of food gets wasted as someone may not like the dish that has been served. Also the hotel has a pure veg restaurant which is a let down for foodies but enough food joints around which compensate this.

The authorized travel agent (Anu Travels) will fool you with things as in will not give you things as promised and I had arguments with him on the same.

"Good budget stay","3","2017-05","2017-05-03","Great budget hotel. Spacious rooms, lots of amenities in the rooms. Located at a great location for road trippers to/from Bangalore. Service is prompt and check-in was smooth.

There is no breakfast buffet. Instead you choose two dishes from five and wait for the only server in the restaurant to bring them to you. You have to remind them to bring you your food every 15 minutes. Won't recommend a breakfast plan here. In that time, you can venture into Mysore city and find a great place with a much better service. 

My 3/5 is only because Treebo is discounting right now and because they spoiled our breakfast, wasted 40 crucial minutes of our road trip. Exiting Mysore in the morning out towards NH44 via Chamrajnagar is a problem because of traffic.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r481172101-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg","1200","7","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nishants701","Nishant S","A9CA016BE3676240864EF76D5C9ACEE7",,,,,"nishants701",,"Guest Relations Manager","486021441","en","2017-05-20","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Good rooms, bad policies","3","2017-04","2017-04-08","I don't know if this is the case with all hotels in Mysore, but I have faced religious discrimination on my stay here. As part of our honeymoon, we were travelling by road to Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary and had to take a stop at Mysore for a night. The folks at the reception counter freaked out and started whispering to each other as soon as they saw, from our id cards, that we belong to different religious backgrounds. They whispered to each other and made calls, while we were waiting at the reception looking like idiots on our honeymoon. When I approached the fellows and asked them what problem they have with us, they said there is some new policy about not allowing ""inter-caste couples"". When I told them that it's not for them to decide what religion or caste their guests belong to, and that we are a married couple on our honeymoon who can provide our marriage certificate on the spot, their attitude immediately changed and they checked us in. They could have just asked us if we're married first and that would have been fine. But, they thought it best to whisper to each other and peer into our id cards to dissect our names and show it to each other and then call up some ""manager for permission"". I must admit the room was excellent, but this is no way to conduct a hotel business in a secular country. They might as well put a saffron flag on the hotel building. Being reporters, both of us could have made a big scene about it. We decided to let it go because we didn't want to get upset on our honeymoon, but then, they did upset us. We expect better from upmarket hotels like Treebo.

Cons: Food quality and taste is not up to the mark. Room services are expensive. 
Suggestion : Ask for tea without Sugar as the Chef doesn't seem to know the amount that needs to be added and the Sugar is at the higher level and it spoils the Tea taste.
Mattress in the room needs to be replaced and the sleep is not comfortable at all and bumpy.

"Decent but can be better","4","2017-03","2017-03-23","Firstly a couple of points that need improvement: 
1.  The room allotted to us - ie 205 has a noisy AC.  It kept making these loud scary sounds every 15 mins - but since we we just stopping over for a couple of hrs we let it be.  
2.  The breakfast would have been more exciting if we had the usual buffet - somehow selecting 2 options from the list of 4 kinda put a damper on the meal.  (Maybe its just me but i love my breakfast spread when I'm travelling - its one of the things i really look forward to)
3.  The room was missing the usual list of nos - 9 for reception etc.  If i was a 1st time traveller - I'm sure id be feeling lost.  

Other than that .. the room with respect to cleanliness & ambience seemed really good.  The team at the reception during checkin was polite and courteous and the checkin was absolutely hassle free.  Stay at this place is indeed value for money.

"Nice budget hotel. Complete value for money.","4","2013-07","2013-07-02","I opted for 2 non ac rooms (as weather is cool nowdays). The rooms were spacious with LCD TV, complimentary tea/coffee, hair dryer, Fridge etc. They dont have their own kitchen but they take your order and get it delivered from outside. I read in some reviews that ppl were unhappy about the food. I guess, they read it, and now the food is very good. And yes reasonable price. Nice staff. Parking. Best thing is its location. Its right in the centre of all tourist stuff. Mysore palace is 1km, the famous church is 0.5km etc.

Negative - The bed mattress was not good. They have spring mattresses which are not very comfortable. Besides, they had queen beds in the rooms that I booked.

"Good value for money","3","2013-06","2013-06-27","We stayed in Kings Kastle on Ashoka road for one night. The location is qood, as it's quite close to the palace. They also arrange for city tours, which is nice as it avoids haggling with local tour operators. 

Since there were four people in our group, we booked the 4 bed AC room from makemytrip. The hotel seemed to be a new construction and was quite clean and well maintained. Wifi speed was good and uninterrupted, and the room was also good. They have LED lighting on the false ceiling, which makes it a little unique. Toilets were clean when we arrived, and we were provided four sets of towels and bedsheets. They also have room service (but no restaurant), but we just ate at a local restaurant nearby. 

The only complaint I had was that even though we booked what they call a '4 bed room', the room just had one queen bed and a sofa that folds out into a bed. The sofa-cum-bed was quite uncomfortable as there was a hard wooden plan right where you back goes. Plus no extra blankets were provided. So it's better to book two twin rooms instead of the family room.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r165506387-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"450","46649408","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/c7/d0/40/vj-mehta.jpg","474","43","42","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vj_mehta","vj_mehta","DEBED1F986F12A4588F423FB898BAC8E",,"33020","San Jose, California","San Jose","vj_mehta",,"Front Office Manager","166702941","en","2013-07-08","ragtan","Dear Sir

We completely enjoyed the stay. the one star missing in the rating is poor quality of food. It is just a so-so and you should not go with the dish name as the name in the menu and dish on the plate do not match at all.

"Decent budget hotel","3","2013-06","2013-06-11","I travelled to Mysore alongwith friends and we were in need of a decent budget hotel as our motto was just to sleep in hotel.. King's Kastle is located in the middle of city so dats beneficial.. Also staff is polite but there is language barrier.. They dont understand much of hindi or english, specially the waiters or service guys.. Room was clean and bathroom was huge and clean too.. We booked a 3 seater non ac room and pricing was also fair.. But the hotel doesn't have its own kitchen though they have their own menu card which has very limited options for food.. They get this food from other hotels so u have to clear the food bill on the spot itself.. Over and above a average budget hotel","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r163728875-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1504","67618819","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/07/c8/03/kshitij-g.jpg","1458","3","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KshitijG145","Kshitij G","C490BC7A995CB7EA4FA33DE2D206F717",,,,,"KshitijG145",,"Front Office Manager","185651094","en","2013-11-23","ragtan","Dear Guest,

"Little noisy and less parking space - Good value for Money","4","2013-03","2013-04-01","We stayed in Hotel for 2 days. 
Sleep : The initial day the the hotel is noisy because some repair was happening in grond floor so cant sleep properly.
Location : Very near to bus stand, Also Mysore church is at walkeble distance.
Extras : They charge if you use the Water bottel/Cans in your room.
Parking : The hotel is in main place so the parking is conjested the next day we parked at the Main Road which is not much safe.
Rooms : Looks very good and modern.
Overall : Unless these above the hotel is GOOD FOR MONEY.

The service is really good that even at 11PM in the night, they managed to get the food we ordered in 15 mins.  Food ordered was serverd really fast at all times. The staff were very friendly & most importantly not money minded. Hotel is just  10 mins walkable distance from KSRTC bus stop, 20 rs by auto.

"Very nice and comfortable stay","5","2013-02","2013-03-02","I was in Mysore in mid Feb 2013 for site seeing, the hotel is very close to the Railway station. The hotel was new and neatly maintain, rooms were spacious. Hotel Staff were good, they don't have their own restaurant but they were getting the room service in decent price. While booking i inquired about the package, the hotel price was slightly more when approached directly, however using cleartrip this has further discount. Overall i had a nice stay in this hotel.

"Good for the location.","3","2013-01","2013-01-29","I had travelled along with my wife and in laws. The hotel was located bang in the centre of the city and most places were accessible by foot. The parking is cramped and can hardly hold 7 cars at the max. The staff though courteous, do not provide much in terms of service. We had to remind them multiple times for cleaning the rooms. Overall, i would say that it is value for money hotel, if you are looking to spend most of our time sightseeing.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r150918909-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452390050","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","1200","7","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shubhrangshuc","shubhrangshu c","F3AF4020877EF87E43A8357749DD1365",,,,,"shubhrangshuc",,"Owner","150988230","en","2013-01-29","ragtan","Thanks for your feedback.","No 69 Ashoka Road, Mysuru (Mysore) 570001 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570001","Karnataka","No 69 Ashoka Road",,"3575720","12.31044","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.65605","Kings Kastle","173","3.6","15","11","39","64","44","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d3575720-Reviews-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.thekingskastle.com"
"Good hotel in competitive budget.","4","2013-01","2013-01-28","I stayed there for one night. Looks like this was a newly build hotel. Rooms were clean, but it is exactly good for 2 adult not more than that (not even an infant). Parking arrangement was fine. But the improvement point is ""that should build up own restaurant with plenty recipe"". Because currently they bring food from outside, but still i will say it is fast. It is located close to center of city, just opposite to the ""state bank of mysore"". That area is little crowded, but inside the hotel is not at all noisy. Rooms were clean, and best part is there is a ""Good night active"" available in every room :-).... Good to hear that they are taken this step after ""Dengue"" problem started in Karnataka. Do not expect to have internet connectivity, but good 3G connection in that area. I would say, better to bring food from outside for lunch and dinner. Overall stay was good.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r150841384-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","3","15","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manas84","manas p","6E7617174BFEDC6C49942EF3E4806882",,,,,"Manas84",,"Owner","150988039","en","2013-01-29","ragtan","Thanks for your valuable feedback.

"Rooms are good value, if you can cope with the noise","2","2012-12","2012-12-22","Accommodation at this new hotel in Mysore looks good on first impressions, and seems like solid value with rates starting from 1,000 Rupees. The beds are fine, there is cable TV and mostly there is hot water (though not necessarily in the morning when you really want it). 

However it is located on a noisy street with a LOT of honking and the rooms are situated around a courtyard carpark that is like an echo chamber, amplifying tuk tuks revving in and out, doors slamming and the staff who are constantly bellowing at each other. An air vent above the door that destroys any sound insulation does not help matters. The bathrooms are also quite smaill and there is little natural light.from the courtyard facing window.

There is complimentary Wifi, but I had to ask five times before I received the information that allowed me to log on. The rooms are clean and present quite well, but I found the noise level maddening. It's a pity noise was not taken into consideration during the design of this hotel, as otherwise it would be a good mid-range choice.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d3575720-r147892275-Kings_Kastle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"412","36355453","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2a/bd/7d/soggychops.jpg","550","24","24","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotanditchy","hotanditchy","7072EF0D5EA32D0F9AA0BD3797528616",,"2397909","El Paso County, Colorado","El Paso County","hotanditchy",,"Owner","148764433","en","2013-01-03","ragtan","Thanks for your valued feedback. We remember that there was an festival/event organized just opposite to our hotel during your stay. We had mentioned this noise is because of the festival arrangement throughout the city for a day during this time of the year. Otherwise we are going full occupancy and not much issues on the noise level.  

Wifi issue was because of the bad Service from BSNL.

"Decent stay","4","2017-01","2017-01-19","Stayed here as family ( 5 people including a kid - 2 rooms). The rooms and bathrooms  are decently spacious and clean and beds are comfortable.
They have 3 different restaurants serving different cuisine ( south Indian Veg, Chinese and continental, north Indian) which are good. 

Additionally they have a parking in the basement( though it was not clean, may be because of some renovation going on at the time of our visit)
 
Location of this hotel is at the city center, which is close to all the tourist places of interest in the city.

The only cons - a couple of receptionists need soft skills training. ( On arrival the lady at desk insisted on cash payment and  bluntly refused to accept card payment for additional person in the room. Though this was sorted out  later during checkout, and they accepted card payment  when the other receptionist at service spoke to the management 
Overall. Second incident was when the access card of the room was not working and I went down to the reception and stated my concern that the card did not work 3 times in both the rooms since check in that afternoon .  The  reply I got from the receptionist was "" I don't think so "", which was shocking and annoying. Though he did something on the computer and the issue did not reoccur.

Comfort - 4/5
Cleanliness - 4/5
Cost - 4/5
Service - 2 ( majorly because of unfriendly approach of receptionist )
Breakfast ( complimentary) - 3.5/5 ( only veg)
Location - 4.5/5

Overall - I would recommend this hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r453490279-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"705","89166190","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/50/91/6e/vipul-v.jpg","960","12","107","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525vipulv","Vipul V","6DB15F3991D286CFBFB1C2FCA51FF54B",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","525vipulv",,"Guest Relations Manager","455790763","en","2017-01-29","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Nice but not a true Treebo","3","2016-12","2016-12-20","Stayed there with my wife for two days. Everything was very clean and comfortable. But some small things were not up to expectations. Very good location, fifteen minutes to Mysuru railway station. Lot of eateries nearby. The hotel has a travel desk which was friendly and reasonable in price. The Chinese non-vegetarian food was excellent but the complimentary breakfast was limited and average. The room was huge and bed was very comfortable. The bad part was the air-conditioner was making cracking noise frequently which was very disturbing at night. There was a tea coffee maker but the provisions were limited. They also had given one complimentary mineral water bottle for two persons! The wi-fi was weak and never got connected smoothly. The bathroom was huge and had a bathtub, but did not have bath curtains. So whenever we took a bath, the whole room almost got wet.

"Average hotel","2","2016-12","2016-12-17","We stayed here for 1 night on our way to Coonoor from Pune. 
Pros - Location and basement parking facilities. Plus a special mention to the security guard who went a step ahead and cleaned our car. Plus the downstairs ""Veg only"" restaurant service was great.
Cons - Based on few of our experience , we found that the hotel management (including Treebo management) was naive and unprofessional. 
1. First of all when we checked in  , there were no towels in the bathroom and after we called the reception twice , we got them. Normally you dont see that in any standard business hotels. 
2. Then we had a very sour experience with the dinner which we took at the upstairs restaurant as the hotel served non veg upstairs. While the food was good , the restaurant service was slow and very poor. Plus the restaurant was adamant on paying the food bill right away and asked for cash as their card swipe machine was somehow not working - which was very strange and naive on their part. 
3. Then came another bitter experience - that was during checkout. While I had paid the room charges in advance , the front desk guy insisted to pay the charges citing that they don't accept the advance payment. It was after I showed them my credit card statement (had to download the same) , and him contacting the finance department , that I was allowed to check out - with the whole process taking 40 minutes. It seems there is a BIG DISCONNECT between Treebo finance team and the hotel management and ultimately I had to suffer for the same. Even now I have not got my hotel bill as the receptionist kindly said that my payment is not settled in their hotel management system. 
Overall impression - While hotel itself was good and was located at a very nice location and rooms were decent , the hotel service was not up to the mark.

"Well Beyond Expectations","5","2016-12","2016-12-16","My wife and I stayed at this hotel on our way back from a Nagarhole National Park visit. We booked this place about a week before our trip based on reviews on Trivago.com and the short duration of our stay. Just so you know, I have never been more satisfied with a hotel room like this one for the price that I paid. (Rps. 1450 per night)

The hotel is located on a main road in Mysore very close to the railway station, palace and other places of interest. From the outside its a little understated, similar to other hotels on this strip. But once you step in, its a whole different world. The reception is spacious and extremely clean. Varsha at the reception was very kind and cordial helping us check in quickly and easy. We requested rooms towards the rear of the hotel away from the main road to avoid the noise. 

The rooms themselves are very spacious, clean and well appointed with a large bathroom, excellent shower, powerful air conditioning, fast WiFi and a big screen TV in case you need it. We had absolutely no complaints about it. I still couldn't believe the deal we got for this room and what was being offered! 

The restaurant on the ground floor is also wonderful with tasty food priced affordably. The staff are also very courteous and service was quick. They offer complimentary breakfast which was also delicious. 

I honestly don't know why you wouldn't choose this place to stay in Mysore unless you seek a higher level of luxury or you're on a company account. Its clean, spacious, convenient to access and has great food. If we are in Mysore again, we're definitely staying here again.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r444598882-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","46","30","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viroop","Viroop","3EC6905746213669B182451FF1B9EE12",,"294207","Nairobi, Kenya","Nairobi","Viroop",,"Guest Relations Manager","455787206","en","2017-01-29","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Would stay again ","3","2016-12","2016-12-14","We just stayed for one night here. We are not really city people so one night in Mysore was quite enough for us and we also found that we were able to see everything there was to see in one day. However Golden Castle is a good place to stay and well located for seeing all the main sites. We actually walked everywhere and found we didn't need rickshaws. The hotel is quite new and everything still feels very new and clean. Our bedroom was spacious and there was even room to roll out my yoga mat and do yoga in the morning. They also have nice hot showers which is something we have not always found in India. The only negatives were the breakfast and the inability of the staff to give us a map. We wanted to walk around the city but of course cannot use google maps without internet and most hotels we have stayed in before have had maps available but this one didn't and that made things a bit difficult as they also couldn't tell us where to get a map from. At breakfast time we headed to the main restaurant where breakfast was served but upon seeing that we were westerners we were then ushered away to a separate restaurant upstairs where we were told we could have eggs. We had the eggs but this was literally all they gave us and there also wasn't anything to drink except tea or coffee, for example no juice or water. I am not sure if we would have had more choice if we had been allowed to stay downstairs but I think it would be better if they served the western style breakfasts in the same place as the Indian ones so that everybody can have choice. However the restaurants looked like they would be very nice places for dinner, especially the vegetarian Indian one downstairs and we wish we had eaten here instead of the place we did choose for our dinner (park lane hotel) as it looked much nicer.

"Comfortable Stay. VFM with added bonus of helpful staff","4","2016-08","2016-11-28","It's a relatively new hotel and we stumbled upon it by chance. 

We were Pleasantly surprised by the room and the cost factor. The hotel is worth every penny you spend. 

Rooms : Large, Clean, with cozy bed , clean linens and nice view. The lightening fixtures are a good touch.

Toilets : Large, Clean with adequate toiletries.

Parking  :Available

Best part was the Room Service and Staff. very polite, helpful and non interfering. Will definitely recommend for their service. During one of the nights when power cut was on and generator was non functional, they went on to the extent to call local electricity board office and Assistant engineer to log a issue and follow up on same.

A functional restaurant will be really nice addition to the hotel.

Will definitely recommend to all. Go for it.

"Avoid if possible","2","2016-11","2016-11-14","Well we stayed here for one day, and is that's the reason the service was so bad then I have nothing to say. The room was average , nothing special and we weren't expecting anything out of the ordinary. What irritated me was first the front desk was rude and took like forever to get us checked in. Then once we went in the room , the bathrooms were wet with water every where. There were no towels , no even hand towels. After calling them twice did the house keeping service gut come. When  I asked him why it was like that , he didn't have a answer. Next we ordered in-room service, the food was average. Then they came with the bill and insisted that we pay there and then , when we asked can't it wait and put in the room bill. They said no. Horrible. Even the breakfast is limited. You get to choose from 6 things and that's all. You can choose upto two things nothing more.

"Very nice and modern hotel!","4","2016-09","2016-10-16","The reception staff was very kind and helpful. 
​
Room was amazing! Very nice bathroom with great water pressure!
The WiFi was fast, but quite annoying to log on to and to stay connected.
Breakfast was simple, but good. They should probably add some chairs and tables so everybody can sit.

​There was some construction going on, but we weren't too bothered by it. 
Restaurants are across the street.
Train station closeby (6 minutes riskhaw) which was convenient for us.

The laundry service is HORRIBLE! Please don't use this 'service' in this hotel! 2 shirts were ruined by someone else's clothes and they never appologized for it! Clothes didn't smell clean after the wash. On top of that, 2 shorts were missing and had 2 pieces of someone else's clothes instead. The laundry guy wanted to rip us off by overcharging us 200%. After we complained at the front desk, the manager helped us out and she was very understanding about the situation and acted very professional.

Overall we had a very nice stay and we can definitely recommend this hotel!

"A decent hotel close to the Railway Station","4","2016-08","2016-08-29","Stayed for one night on Aug 27th, did my booking through booking.com, got a good deal.
Check in went off smoothly, the room was spacious clean and neat, staff were helpful.

The breakfast was complimentary and OK, the room they served breakfast was very cramped and could not accomodate the guests. No restaurant in the hotel, have to pick up from outside, couple of choices available opposite the hotel, which is OK.

It is about 1 km plus to the railway station.

It is a no smoking hotel, which I didnt know while booking, had to keep going out whenever there was a need to smoke which was a pain.

There was some renovation work being done, and there was a constant noise due to this, which was disturbing while trying to catch a nap in the afternoon.

Overall is a good place to stay for the amount they charged","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r412215216-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452389859","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","1200","2","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JR12347","JR12347","D4999937F5AE89C73D8F8DAB6F4F7E07",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","JR12347",,"Guest Relations Manager","418449450","en","2016-09-14","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Nice and comfortable stay within budget","5","2016-08","2016-08-11","Went there with husband for office work. The hotel is near to railway station. The staff is very nice. The rooms are clean. They give complimentary water, tea bags, coffee, soap, shampoo and moisturiser. They will refill the items when they cklean the room. But you have to tell at the reception to clean the rooms.
Food: Idli, poha/noodles, egges(2), tea, coffee, bread butter-jam, watermelon juice, fruits etc. Very tasty food. Breakfast usually starts at 8:30 am.
TV: Good TV but no english channels.

"Disappointed","2","2016-08","2016-08-08","Rooms are pretty decent for the price. Surprisingly saw foreigners staying there too. However, they forced me to check out even though I had clearly mentioned at the time of booking that I would need to check out at 3 pm instead of the standard 11 a.m. time. And even when I was ready to pay extra for extending the stay, I was asked to check out. I ended up hunting for a last minute hotel booking just for 3 hours! 

Will definitely NOT recommend anyone after such poor service.

The call center executive was very polite and gave information about hotel and services very clearly and patiently. She also gave me combination of rooms to get better rates.  I was very much convinced  to book this hotel, after talking the call center executive. 
I had  requested for early check in and hotel obliged subject to availability. 
It is a new property and rooms are specious, clean and up to the standards. The staff is good and attentive. 
Breakfast was not served hot and service was not up to hotel’s standards. (Still the hotel don’t have their own restaurants and breakfast is outsourced from catering co).
Hotel offers limited free wifi (500 mb) which is not sufficient.

"Good stay","4","2016-06","2016-06-15","A 3 yr old hotel, but well maintained. We booked thru expedia (1400 rupees) which in India, allows you to reserve the room and the flexibility to pay money at checkout.
Good Vegetarian restaurants are not available closeby. The nearest one is Nalpak restaurant. The hotel is 3 kms from Mysore palace. We even had our car washed by the security guy for 50 bucks. Overall a satisfying stay.

Good things to go with:
Clean rooms (200 sq.ft)
Bathroom of very high quality
Beds are comfortable
Wide staircase steps
Wifi-good speed

The not so good things:
Parking is an issue as there is hardly space for 5-6 cars
In-house restaurant is not available, but they bring food from outside (7 km away) which is of average quality. We had only eaten breakfast here.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r382838293-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452387345","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg","1200","112","125","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torblore","torblore","88BE531F4E2B0667F26FEAAB5D1F99C3",,,,,"torblore",,"Guest Relations Manager","387230337","en","2016-06-28","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"New, clean, spacious and reasonable hotel.","5","2016-06","2016-06-04","We loved our stay at Golden Castle, Treebo in June first week, 2016. We had chosen the place only for a night's halt on our way to Coorg, based on the tripadvisor reviews and the rate of approx 1500/- per night. But the hotel exceeded our expectations. 

It had big , spacious rooms and was sparkling clean. It even had wifi and subscription of all HD channels, enabling me to share hubby dearest to catch up on his football matches. The breakfast was served hot , even though they didnt have a restaurant of their own. 

Definitely worth the rate.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r379698610-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"412","54075779","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/39/21/83/halakbaroda.jpg","550","34","66","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HalakBaroda","HalakBaroda","7CCB985A874D4A01FC477F726F4F567E",,"297613","Vadodara, India","Vadodara","HalakBaroda",,"Guest Relations Manager","381083903","en","2016-06-09","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Modern, Luxurious but lack of Restaurant in the Hotel","4","2016-03","2016-05-22","Visited this hotel on the month of March, 2016. The hotel is located opposite to Rail station, and was easy to locate. Also you may find the location in the google map which shows the correct location.

The hotel has parking facility and the gate keep/security person was helpful.

Enter the Hotel, and you will realise that its a modern hotel with nice and clean interior.

The receptionist was not very welcoming or I would say the approach was lethargic however not bad in any manner.

Enter the room, its big one, equipped with A\C, And cupboard. There was electric kettle available along with tea bag, coffee, sugar, dairy whitener.

Room was clean, bed was neat, other things were in place properly.

Restroom/Bathroom room was clean, well decorated, running hot water, clean towels, soaps, moisturiser and etc.

They serve packaged drinking water only, no flask available.

The hotel does not have any kitchen, hence plan your lunch or dinner arrangements well ahead of time and you need to goto outside restaurants to fulfil your appetite :-( .The Hotel must start its own kitchen.

Complementary breakfast had lot of options (They must have outsourced it as they do not have kitchen). And food was tasty.

Overall I was happy just because of the cleanliness and modernized interior of the hotel. Also room was really comfortable. But they should make kitchen available in the hotel itself and stuff's approach towards guest should be more welcoming and warming.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r375620659-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","177452243","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/93/b4/d3/saptarshi-c.jpg","50","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaptarshiC42","Saptarshi C","758A88F2524A0563DB39015AA94027B7",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","SaptarshiC42",,"Guest Relations Manager","376481649","en","2016-05-25","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Newly built hotel - Poorest of service","2","2016-05","2016-05-10","Pro's : Rooms were neat & clean.

Needs Improvement: 
1. Room Service - Had to give quite a few reminders for basic things like Water Bottle, Cleanliness.
2. Dining Area needs makeover, tables are not cleaned, unhygenic way of serving breakfast. food was good though.
3. Very poor service provided by staff. they will wake you up early morning (6.30 - 7 am) to collect charges for water bottle (they charge more than average for a water bottle).
4. They take unnecessary laundry charges claiming that the towels were unclean-able.

"Weekend in Mysore","3","2016-04","2016-04-21","We booked online and got a decent fare for the rooms for the weekend stay. Rooms - spacious and nice. Well maintained as well. No room service, since they don't have a in-house restaurant. 

Food - They serve breakfast in the dining area - guess it's outsourced. Was decent enough. 

WiFi - works but it is slower than what one would expect. Felt the 3G on the phones were at times, faster. 

Overall Service - could be better in terms of how they handle customer requests. 

An add-on point - The Road in front of the hotel was being repaired/fixed. So, we had to get around another route to reach the gate. Once the road is fully done, access should be pretty straightforward.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r366216806-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","148607646","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/db/92/9e/girishkrishnamurthy.jpg","50","9","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/higirish","Girish K","12FE777E3DB97DF9C6F335EC19AFA8AA",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","higirish",,"Guest Relations Manager","372821331","en","2016-05-14","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Amazing...clean...excellent room","4","2016-04","2016-04-15","So we travelled to Mysore for a break and din wanna spend much money.
My husband checked out the hotel pictures on Google and decided it was worth the money we were paying.
We reached Mysore by bus and it took us just three hours from Bangalore.
Wen we reached it was abt 10.30/am the check in time as per the hotel is 11 am . we requested to check in early as we wanted to visit the chamundi hills temple and were genuinely in a hurry.
But that lady at the reception was so rude and impolite it really put us off and we began to wonder if our choice of the hotel was right.
She wud not allow us to check in and even asked to us to pay 300 bucks etc if we wanted to check in 15mins early. All we wnated to do was put out luggage into the room and go to the temple as it closes at 1pm. Anyways she din allow us to check in. So we left our luggage at the lobby and went off to the temple.
The roads were under construction so wen u get a bus at the bus stop remeber to give the land mark as sayajji road and Santosh hotel. It costs only 25 max 30bucjs don pay more. They ll charge u around 50-60. Ola cab costs 60 bucks.
We went to the city bus stop by auto. It costs u onky 25rs. From there we took a bus directly to chamundi hills. The bus costs only 28rs and it's AC and completely worth it. Cab charges u somewhere between 500-600 bucks.
We then offered our prayers and returned.
I was ald upset abt the hotel and the way that receptionist behaved but however since we had ald booked the room online we decided to check out the room.
Wen we went into the room... It was d complete opp of the lobby downstairs and the receptionist s behavior... It was splendid and fabulous.... A very good amazing clean hotel for a two star rating.
It was brilliant the room. Just perfect and how we imagined it to b...
We were so happy and it was worth every penny. Had good room service and good AC and TV etc.
We stayed two nights and it was worth it completely...we were extremely satisfied with the rooms.
However we were disappointed with the breakfast tat was offered complimentary.. It's not great. Besides that bf area really needs to b done up. It's a put off.
Also there is no kitchen i guess in d hotel so we ordered dinner from nandhini hotel (found it on zomato) the food from there was really yummy.
However over all a good clean and decent budget stay. Def the rooms are over 3star category.
Tip : Don judge the place by the receptionist and the downstairs lobby.
Tip : Make sure u don get cheated by these auto guys.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r364429524-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"850","496455401","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/97/4e/e9/anagharsarma.jpg","850","35","181","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anagharsarma","Anagha","CF17D9320D151029D640A80EDFFBE1DC",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","anagharsarma",,"Guest Relations Manager","374453532","en","2016-05-19","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Nice Hotel with less Amenities","3","2016-04","2016-04-11","Nice Rooms. New hotel, Bath rooms are neatly maintained. Beds and towels are clean and fresh. Bit less-comfort in reaching the hotel because of Road work, once that is completed location would be the main attraction for this hotel. 
Good hotel for those who compromise few Amenities. For those who are keen on the amenities then this is not a hotel for them.
In room we could find the smell of smoking, even though smoking is not allowed in the room. 
1. Amenities:-
------------------ 
a) No Restaurants. 
b)No room service- foods cannot be served to room since they don't have their own restaurant (They can serve only water).
c) No choice of restaurants around that area only few are available.
d) Electric water cattle is provided that is good, Whitener, tea bags, coffee powder sugar has been provided as a complimentary. Which is good.
e) It is said as free Wifi I am not sure where it was.
f)We have to park the car outside. Since there are no vehicular movement due to road construction we can manage to park it on platform.
g) They outsource the complementary break fast. on seeing the four table and ten chairs, we don't want to take risk in having the food in that place so we went out.    
h) windows curtain cannot be kept open, Adjacent locality are not good to see.

2) Service Quality
----------------------
a) we can give 2/5 when your check out time is nearing they will opening the room with their master key and will start cleaning the room, We have to wait out side till they complete the cleaning, and not suppose to use the item that refill (water bottle etc)","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r363256361-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452361217","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg","1200","7","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ranji_ram","ranji_ram","2D02E7D80892E36372A4040E33E204A6",,"1102838","Hosur, India","Hosur","ranji_ram",,"Guest Relations Manager","374451224","en","2016-05-19","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

The breakfast spread was good and served with lots of personal care.Staff members were very helpful.The only negative factor happened to be the bathroom lock.The lock could not be opened from inside the bathroom.While complaining about this to the reception staff we found that another guest also had a similar problem.I hope by now the management must have taken care of it.

We had to ask them to change the sheets when we arrived because it hadn't been done. It was swiftly taken care of.

"New property has a way to go","3","2016-03","2016-03-30","The location is good. The roads were under construction. Room was excellent with a some flaws. The bathtub stopper, by the way I really enjoyed, was broken but that didn't stop me from stuffing a towel in the drain.

My biggest dissatisfaction was that my room was not cleaned. I came back in the evening to see that my room wasn't cleaned. I inquired and was told that room aren't cleaned unless requested. It is policy. I asked the manager on duty to please in the future inform guests of this when they checkin. He pointed to a sign that has the policy written but it is on the other end of the counter. Sheets and towels were replaced and a bottle of water was given.

The breakfast and eating area itself needs some help. It appears that this hotel is still being furnished. Hope that is being handled.

The next day during check out I was asked by a day manager if there is anything that could have improved my stay. I shared with him about notifying guests about the room cleaning policy. He began to give me several reasons. I shared with him I am making a suggestion as a business owner to improve your customer service. Please consider. He said in Kannada ""This guy doesn't know what he is talking about to another staff person."" All the while trying to keep a smile. 

I quickly left the hotel. No need to engage in such behavior. It did leave a sourness to how I exited the hotel. That wan't even necessary. I have mixed feeling about the hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r360088563-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"366","288552094","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/32/f4/9e/agentbey.jpg","366","16","50","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agentbey","agentbey","FEA739074C2DECF498D735B535507E37",,"60795","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Philadelphia","agentbey",,"Guest Relations Manager","360353127","en","2016-03-31","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"First Mysore visit","4","2016-03","2016-03-12","We went to Mysore with family from Bangalore. I had booked 4 star hotel before booking treebo golden castle. I had booked the 2 rooms for 8k for one night, when i read the reviews of this hotel and the cost i was getting is alsmost 90% less then what i had booked, I thought to give a try and cancelled my booking of other 4 star hotel. 

I was really amazed to see the kind of rooms they have , they are actually beautiful & neat, its a new property and very good to stay for night or 2 or even more. Only challenge was food in hotel but there are 4-5 good restaurants just opposite and side of hotel . Facility is just new hence they are coming with their restaurant which will start soon as per them. Staff was good and check in check out was smooth. I will definitely recommend all to try this place once for sure, It is very near to Mysore palace & zoo 5 mns away & chamundi hills 15 mns away.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r354932376-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452390812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg","1200","2","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vishalkatoch9000","vishalkatoch9000","D3000BEA999533193171FCDEA2A2864E",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","vishalkatoch9000",,"Guest Relations Manager","355442002","en","2016-03-14","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Très bon hôtel","5","2016-03","2016-03-07","Ma chambre au second étage était très grande, 25 m² au moins, avec un grand lit moelleux, la clim, un coin salon, un coin cuisine, un coin pour travailler, la Wifi (qui rame un peu), une vue dégagée, une bouilloire et un choix de boissons chaudes, etc... Ma salle de bain est immense aussi, équipée d’une baignoire. 
Seul point négatif : le petit-déjeuner typiquement Inde du Sud n’est malheureusement servi qu’à partir de 8H, voire 8H15, livré dans une pièce inconfortable, dans l'attente de l'ouverture d'un restaurant sur place.

"Nice new room at a fantastic price","5","2016-02","2016-03-01","I've given 5 stars based mainly on the excellent value for money that I feel this hotel provides at the price I paid (around 1200 rupees a night). 

The hotel is almost brand new and as stated in previous reviews the shower really is excellent! The AC unit was nice and quiet and the tv had a few english film channels which is always a nice option to have. The wifi was strong. I felt the staff were helpful and always willing to satisfy any requests we had.

If the price was to increase, they would have to improve in a few areas, but at the moment it's a bit of a steal. 

BEWARE - avoid the rickshaw driver that waits out front of the hotel with a sign that says 'Tourist Friendly Auto' on the front of his vehicle. He is just there to rip off tourists. He lies by telling you that he is a 'government recognised guide' and will just try to take you to numerous shops so he can get commission from them. Do yourself a favour - walk up the street 100 yards  and grab another rickshaw. This will save you a lot of time in the long run as you will actually be taken to where you want to go without any hassle!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r352269815-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,,,,,"17","29","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luke850","Luke850","633465BF7EC5A78467F7492E6064C8DB",,,,,"Luke850",,"Guest Relations Manager","353020743","en","2016-03-04","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Happy Stay at Treebo Golden Castle","5","2016-02","2016-02-20","I stayed at Treebo Golden Castle Mysore for one night as a break journey.
It was a really nice and enjoyable stay.

Considering the price paid, I would say it exceeded my expectations. The hotel is new and much effort is taken to keep the rooms clean by the staff. 

The staff was nice and professional. Check-in and out was a breeze. 

While there is no restaurant at the hotel, I think it's nice they still try to offer a complimentary breakfast. I appreciate the effort. If you want to eat elsewhere you can always do so. 

Of course if you are expecting luxury then you might want to stay elsewhere but I think you should give it a shot.  I think for an economical stay, Treebo Golden Castle in Mysore is awesome!!!!

"A new and refreshing hotel in Mysuru","4","2016-02","2016-02-16","I got a good deal while booking online at this hotel but after going through the reviews, I was little skeptical about my stay here.
Nonetheless I chose this hotel because of its rooms, wi-fi service and complimentary breakfast and I am happy to say it was a good decision.
As the hotel is newly built, the restaurant isn't ready yet so you only get the complimentary breakfast as of now between 8 - 9.30 am in morning at the second floor. 

The room was lovely, fitted with all amenities, neat and clean and the wi-fi service was very good. The check-in and check out process was smooth desk staff was courteous.

On second day of my stay when I returned in afternoon the room was not cleaned up yet and when I raised this issue, the staff immediately attended to it and cleaned up everything in couple of minutes.

So overall a comfortable stay, good location (on the main road so easy to locate), and value for the money. Would surely give a try once more when I visit next.

P.S. The ayurvedic spa has some good deals though I missed trying it out.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r348101065-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"574","136676451","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/25/84/63/dsumesh99.jpg","574","43","130","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsumesh99","dsumesh99","8C66DB5BEA365B68D1BF71C8D8B724F7",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","dsumesh99",,"Guest Relations Manager","348371542","en","2016-02-16","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Not ready for Europeans!","2","2015-11","2016-02-05","Clean newly built hotel - and still finishing it! The staff were attempting to be efficient but just came across as rude. They're not set up to take a European credit card so demanded cash. We agreed to pay before we left but were woken up at 7am by a call the next morning demanding payment again! 
Breakfast room was temporary whilst the restaurant isn't built so food and drink was limited. Although it didn't look like a problem on the map the hotel is a little out of the way and walking everywhere wasn't really the option. There is however an amazing family restaurant that serves Dosas across the road that I wish I could remember the name off.  Visit Mysore Palace - it's amazing!

When I asked to use a bathroom they directed me towards some toilet in the middle of a building site which hasn't been cleaned for ages... In the evening they had NO WATER. There were five people hanging at the reception and they didn't even move to try and fix the problem. The location could have been better - it is quite a walk from the palace and other places of interest. Breakfast was served in some dusty room with two low tables and some chairs scattered around.

"New and cool","4","2015-12","2016-01-14","Hotel Golden Castle is a part of Treebo group. I booked the room online via Treebo website and the user sign-up had a discount !!. No advance was paid and the booking was seamless. I got Treebo booking conformation message and subsequent messages regarding 'how to reach' and google location. Cool stuff !!

Location of the hotel is great. It is hardly a kilometer from Mysore Junction railway station and all the major hot spots are pretty near. The property is new and well maintained. The check-in process was standard. Rooms were clean and tidy. Wifi was decent. 

There is no in-house restaurant and the buffet breakfast lacked a proper dining space, which I feel is a big miss. The inclusive buffet breakfast was decent with limited options. 

Service of the staff was not up-to industrial standards. There are plenty of budget restaurants around the hotel to choose for meal options.

Hotel has an ayurvedic massage center. No comments on it. Overall I feel that Golden Castle is a decent hotel for the rate and its location is attractive.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r339872616-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"209","131298899","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/d3/76/53/nitin6.jpg","209","18","34","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nitin6","Nitin6","DA065AF31AB7D51C4C5F4BE4211CD04D",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","Nitin6",,"Guest Relations Manager","341332836","en","2016-01-19","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

The place was very clean and service was good. The only negative point was the breakfast, as no choice of food. The Hotel does not have a restaurant as such, and food is served and left in a small room in the 2nd Floor for the Guests to help themselves. The choice was only Idli with Sambar and Chutney and Bread with Butter N Jam.Other than this drawback will recommend Golden Castle and also will look for other Treebo managed properties in other locations when travelling.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r335822329-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"50","249055671","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/d8/49/b7/colomborover.jpg","50","6","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510feisalj","Feisal J","CCF909FACEE54D0FECD63B52D72F9FF6",,,,,"510feisalj",,"Guest Relations Manager","337305990","en","2016-01-04","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"awesome room! but that is about it","3","2015-11","2015-12-08","The hotel just open 2 months before i staid there. So the room was clean and the bathroom modern and spotless! Hot water with good pressure 24h.
Bed is big and confortable and room are large. I was able to do my yoga practice in my room.
People at reception are nice and try to help out at their best.
Breakfast is provided, simple one in plastic chair but I believe the dining area is still under construction.

on the down side, 
- the hotel is very noisy. Adding some furniture or even plans in the corridor would help to absorb the noise.
- the sheets of my bed were dirty but after a quick call to reception they have been changed strait away
- some employee would just ring your door bell trying to sell you water while the hotel provide at least one free bottle of water a day.
- there is no good restaurant nearby. the one cross the road (which also provide the food for room service) is not really good and i got food poisoning from there.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r331540847-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"956","135067125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/0c/f5/f5/virginie-c.jpg","956","7","26","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/virginiec709","virginie c","60A5B25AE29FA0DA2C97B304FC29C123",,"255100","Melbourne, Australia","Melbourne","virginiec709",,,,,,,,"#3615/1 Sayyaji Rao Road Opposite Old RMC, Mysuru (Mysore) 570021 India","Mysuru (Mysore)","India","570021","Karnataka","#3615/1 Sayyaji Rao Road","Opposite Old RMC","8728730","12.321884","Mysuru (Mysore), Mysore District, Karnataka","76.64647","Golden Castle","362","4","20","23","43","142","134","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304553-d8728730-Reviews-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html","http://www.hotelgoldencastle.com/index.html"

"Nice room - service is lacking","3","2015-11","2015-11-18","I sometimes will give a hotel a 5 star review if it's staff go above and beyond but it's facilities are basic. For this hotel, it is the other way round. Facilities were good but staff were very underwhelming. It still gets 3/5 based on the price point. If it were any more expensive than what we paid (it appears that it will go up in price once the hotel is complete), I may have lowered my rating. 

The hotel is newish and parts of it are still under construction. The rooms itself are finished and are spacious and modern. Bed was comfortable. No complaints about the room aside from thin walls so noise is a bit of a problem. There is meant to be free wifi but in reality it worked about 15% of the time in the three nights we stayed. 

However, the staff is where this hotel needs to place its attention. First, rooms were not serviced and towels unchanged (beginning to understand that this is not uncommon in India). But, we stayed here for three nights and every time we needed toilet paper we had to go downstairs to ask reception (and we were given the tiniest rolls of toilet paper I have come across in India so far). We organised washing through the hotel (negotiate the first rate they give, they dropped the price from 65 rupees per item after we found a much cheaper service nearby). When our laundry was returned to us, the delivery man stood at our door and demanded that we pay right then for the service. We asked if we could settle the bill at checkout and he refused and stood there until we found cash to pay him. When we asked the hotel where we could buy bottled water (there wasn't an obvious store nearby) they said, no worries - we will send one up to you. Again, when the guy delivered it to us he demanded payment immediately at our door. The hotel staff talked at us, even though we apologised and said that we were unable to understand. They continued repeating what they were saying even though we thought it was clear that we didn't understand. Overall, it did not make for a pleasant experience. It's a shame because the hotel has so much potential. Hopefully, with a bit of staff training this hotel will be worthy of a 5 rating.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r327609124-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"1200","452391659","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg","1200","30","96","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snikem","Snikem","2210A5EBDFB97AC31ECA073465CD04B6",,"255068","Brisbane, Australia","Brisbane","Snikem",,"Guest Relations Manager","329919253","en","2015-11-30","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,

"Nice room..but still in construction","3","2015-11","2015-11-10","I booked via booking.com and the price was pretty good. What i did't knew was that they still building this place. The staff was not really used to run a business yet. So i got woked up at 8 a.m via telephon just to reminded me to eat breakfast. It turns out that the room where the ""buffet"" was is still under construction and there where nothing then a few plastic chairs to sit on. The room was really clean but not fully finished yet, the wifi was less then average but the tv with more then enough canals (also in english) was nice.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304553-d8728730-r325837911-Golden_Castle-Mysuru_Mysore_Mysore_District_Karnataka.html",,"769","159016930","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/7a/67/e2/miro6564.jpg","769","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miro6564","Miro6564","C7D916FB5FC46CCF7C5EC319F540EAE9",,"188062","Canton of Lucerne, Switzerland","Canton of Lucerne","Miro6564",,"Guest Relations Manager","329918610","en","2015-11-30","TreeboHotels","Dear Guest,
