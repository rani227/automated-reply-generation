"Old building, Decent clean rooms, Tricky staff","4","2025-10","2025-10-13","It may be an old fort converted to a hotel. The building has an interesting architecture and some beautiful decorations. Some parts of the building is abandoned or under construction. Hotel is located in a busy bus station area (Sindhi Camp). Nothing touristic there except busy and dirty streets, tiny shops and many vehicles. 

Because of recent bad reviews, before arriving, our travel Coordinator specifically asked for clean and quiet rooms for our group.  And we got clean and quiet rooms in the 3rd floor.  Rooms were nicely decorated and the bed was comfortable. The bathrooms are old and need replacing. No water flow in the shower.

The front desk staff and managers are non responsive and blank. They can’t provide any helpful information or tips to the guests. The bills and payments in the hotel restaurant need to be checked carefully. Overpricing, cash payment irregularities, tricks and mistakes are tried there.

"This hotel please avoid.","2","2025-07","2025-07-10","This hotel is a must avoid. Please avoid going to this hotel. You will get many other hotels at a price much lesser than the price for this hotel. 
Let me explain the pros and cons of this property.

Pros - 
Parking Area is good and safe.
Location is good but given the condition you are travelling to Jaipur by bus.

Cons -
Charging more money for amber suite and giving the room with bare minimum lighting.

Then the reception, reaching out at 2 and the room being not ready. 

The staff works without a smile and with a heavy face as if doing for free.

Then comes the amenities - Two restaurants and not sure on which the food is being ordered and from which the restaurant it is coming.

Food is eremely overpriced. Cost of roti being 55₹ . Dude we are in India we got the wheat in house and we are not importing.

Now the third part and most disgusting one - the travel desk this team is there just to fool people and disturb the guest privacy.

Overall Disgusting Experience !!!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r1017473000-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452390416","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harneha","Hardik Ranjan","8E9F998D59728F534705FA3B2F8C7636",,,,,"Harneha",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

So my concern is that if guest call you so many times you have to be polite ,you shouldnt have given this answer.  I was also hotelier and worked in 5 star Properties in jaipur,udaipur. Thats why i am suggesting your staff to be polite.

"Nightmarish Stay: Fort Chandragupt is a breeding ground for dirt and disgust.","1","2024-12","2024-12-21","My family and I booked two rooms m, hoping for a comfortable base to explore Jaipur. Instead, we were greeted with a scene straight out of a horror movie.
The rooms were absolutely repulsive.  Layers of dust coated every surface some even with cigarette butts, the bed sheets were visibly soiled – it was clear they hadn't been changed, and a musty odor of mold heavy in the air. To our horror, my kids discovered a colony of cockroaches scurrying across the floor and walls. It was utterly disgusting.
Despite our complaints, the staff's response was indifferent and unhelpful. We pressed for a room change but the new rooms offered were equally filthy and infested.  Somehow we stayed in the rooms overnight as we couldn’t find alternative accommodation. The next day my back was hurting due to the worn out and saggy mattress. We were left with no choice but to seek out other accommodations, causing immense stress and wasting precious time during our Jaipur holiday.
This hotel's blatant disregard for hygiene and guest well-being is appalling.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.

"Not for everyone!","1","2024-11","2024-12-09","I would skip this hotel next time. They have no differentiation between smoking and non smoking rooms. We had reserved three rooms , out of which 2 were reeking of cigarette smell. After asking the management to change rooms, they send us a waiter with an air freshener which was equally horrible.
We went to the reception again to ask them firmly to  change our rooms to a non smoking room and they did. That room was pathetic too. They do not provide a hand towel or a bath rug. After requesting the reception to send us a hand towel , the bellboy gave a hand towel which was actually a bath rug. Since we were there for a night only , we did not say anything

The bathroom has a small 1 inch x 1 inch soap that one is supposed to use in showers and handwashing .  The rooms are tiny and they only give one key per room, even if there are more than one person staying in the room. The breakfast buffet was meh.

This place is a place where weddings  are hosted. I don’t know how the management manages to attract possible wedding parties but I would avoid this place .
 The place does have potential to be better as it is a big building. But the way their management runs it , it may not be everyone.
I would give them  1/2 star if I had a choice.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r983817448-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"768","371379880","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/22/ce/a8/manipenny.jpg","768","15","67","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManiPenny","ManiPenny","1EAB4354A2A5AF2CFF3FB214C06E3469",,"56003","Houston, Texas","Houston","ManiPenny",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

The hotel is extremely dirty and poorly managed.The hotel seriously needs to evaluate options for improving general clean liness.Had one of the worst experience in my life.
- Horrible smell upon entry, old dirty broken furniture 
-Fridge was dirty and horrible and the bottom of it was rusty.
-tea kettle broken, 
-bedding was old and worn, bedsheet was torn 
- Under the bed was filthy with dirt and dust looked like it had been forgotten about by the cleaner.
 I’ve come across cockroaches in my hotel room!!so many cockroaches I -    inside in tea kettle, 

Staff are terrible....front desk guys were worst and indifferent..i went with family and they have no consideration...rooms are worst quality.

i complaint hotel manager (RDM)Mr Shubham dhawan, and they assured me that , next morning he will discussed with hotel staff & provide a better solution in within 3 days , but after 12 days,  mr shubham NEVER contacted me & i called so many time to mr dhawan,but he never picks up my calls

Be careful from agoda, their booking parter, Befooling the customers. Booked online one room on 17 Oct 24. On arrival at reception they charged additional one thousand saying one person is mentioned on agoda booking. Was shocked because room is booked at the name of one person only, and no option to add on was on the site of agoda. Room was booked @2800/- and we charged 3800/- organised cheating. However every details was provided at the counter, yet they didn't agreed.  Very unhygienic rooms and inspite of request towel was not kept/provided in the washroom.

"Prime pick!","5","2024-08","2024-09-04","Prime Pick !!

Oh! It was just unforgettable stay in Fort Chandragupta hotel. The moment we walked into the hotel, it felt like we had stepped into a palace. The whole place, from the rooms to the reception area and garden, was designed like a palace. The hotel staff provided excellent service throughout our three-day stay. The room's decor and layout were very nice, and the quality of the breakfast and dinner was also good.

If you're planning a trip to Jaipur, whether for family or business, I highly recommend staying at Fort Chandragupt.

Thanks to : 
- Mr. Ashok at the reception made checking in quick and easy, and the two ladies at the front desk made checking out smooth.
- Mr. Dipak and Ms. Arzu provided excellent service. It's impressive that, while still studying, they both offer such top-notch service. There's no need to wish you both good luck because you're hard workers and have a bright future ahead.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r968267348-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452390050","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trip49372442082","Trip49372442082","735B8FDE35971D85F60E5A3E19C068B7",,,,,"Trip49372442082",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

Visited Laxmi palace hotel with family from 26th Feb to 1st Mar.
Hotel rooms are good, family room was spacious and clean. However the shower area doesn't have bath curtains causing the water to spill over to rest of the area in bathroom. Buffet spread was limited but good.
AVOID THEIR TRAVEL DESK. Very mannerless people. He called me up and started abusing for non payment by some other guest who had taken their service 15 days back. Later after realising his mistake he apologized but he lacked basic manners. He dint even check my name and started abusing.
Also they will charge you a bomb for their services. Better book Ola cabs which will pick you up and drop at hotel. (While returning I checked for railway station drop , they mentioned 300 rs. I got Ola sedan for 100 rs.)","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r996220904-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"412","39345015","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/58/5b/77/shahamit82.jpg","550","14","26","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shahamit82","Amit Shah","E8684DAC76AEC71388827C3810EBDF4B",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","shahamit82",,,,,,,,"D-194, Jagdish Marg, Banipark, Jaipur 302016 India","Jaipur","India","302016","Rajasthan","D-194, Jagdish Marg, Banipark",,"1138118","26.925457","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80113","Laxmi Palace Heritage Boutique Hotel","642","4.2","30","25","71","159","357","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d1138118-Reviews-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://www.laxmipalacehotel.com"

"Laxmi Heritage Boutique Hotel review","3","2024-12","2025-01-07","Here is a formalized and structured version of your review:

Review of My One-Night Stay at the Hotel in Jaipur

During my recent visit to Jaipur, I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel for one night with my family. Below is a detailed review based on my experience.

Pros:
Reception Staff: The reception staff was polite and courteous, though their responses were somewhat to the point. They were professional and welcoming.

Housekeeping: The housekeeping staff demonstrated a positive attitude and were also warm and polite. One of the luggage attendants stood out for his humility. When I was unable to tip him on the first day due to a lack of change, he reassured me not to worry about such formalities.

Dining Experience: We had lunch at the hotel, and I found the food to be enjoyable and satisfactory, meeting our expectations.

Terrace Bar: The terrace bar offered a delightful experience, where we enjoyed a small cultural performance featuring folk music and dance. The atmosphere and ambiance were relaxed and pleasing, enhancing our overall enjoyment.

Transport Services: Zakir Bhai, the in-charge of transport services, was cordial and cooperative. The one-day tour he organized covered most of the major attractions in the area.

Cons:
Room Size: The room allocated to us appeared to be smaller than expected. I raised this concern with the manager during checkout, who informed me that larger rooms are available. However, considering the hotel is rated as a 4-star property, I believe that the minimum room size should be larger than the one provided.

Restaurant Service: The restaurant staff did not fully adhere to specific guest requests. Although I did not opt for breakfast, I requested a special tea (for an additional charge) to be prepared with strong elaichi (cardamom) and sugar incorporated during the preparation. Unfortunately, the staff served the tea as part of the standard breakfast offering, with the sugar provided separately in sachets rather than mixed in as per my request.

Breakfast Spread: Although I did not avail myself of the breakfast, I noticed that the spread could be significantly expanded. Given that the hotel claims to be a 4-star establishment, the variety of the breakfast offering should be improved to match that classification.

Conclusion:
If this property were categorized as a 3-star hotel, I would have rated it 4 stars based on my experience. However, as it is classified as a 4-star property, there are areas that require improvement, particularly in terms of room size and the ability to accommodate specific guest requests.

Overall, this hotel could still be a viable option for a stay, especially if priced competitively.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r988150741-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,,,,,"0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrasB1983","PrasB","F90347B213E0FC3128C4668F95075428",,,,,"PrasB1983",,,,,,,,"D-194, Jagdish Marg, Banipark, Jaipur 302016 India","Jaipur","India","302016","Rajasthan","D-194, Jagdish Marg, Banipark",,"1138118","26.925457","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80113","Laxmi Palace Heritage Boutique Hotel","642","4.2","30","25","71","159","357","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d1138118-Reviews-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://www.laxmipalacehotel.com"

"Beware of Money Extortion by the Manager","1","2024-04","2024-04-30","Beware of Laxmi Palace Heritage Boutique Hotel! Upon check-in, they promised breakfast for both rooms we booked, but after paying, they reneged, claiming it's only for one room. Then, 15 minutes later, the manager demanded extra payment for the third adult, despite earlier assurances that the extra bed was included. The manager's constant changing of terms feels like an attempt to extort money from tourists.

When we refused to pay the extra money which nowhere had mentioned in out booking, the Manager said we should checkout immediately and leave the premises!!

We came from Mauritius and the hotel manager and team tried to rob of with extra charges. The manager was very rude and insulted us. When I told him that I’m reporting this to the Jaipur Police, only then he changed his aggressive behaviour.

"Terrible","1","2025-11","2025-11-15","Service is really poor. We were disturbed at 1 in the midnight. We ordered a fruit platter which was served at12:40. Usually they get bill with food, here they did not get BILL. The person rang bell and disturbed us with bill at one in the night. We had a long day and were tired. And the next day was important as my 13 year old had an important exam.There was also a 7 year old baby . When we asked about time , the person just turned his back and ran , while we were asking his name. We immediately called to main desk and the person there( Shekar) answered our call. We told what had just happened. We told them not to disturb us for the night . Even so a call from dining area came. We were totally disturbed. In the morning while checking out we told the receptionist about this incidents but they did not compensate. They apologised but when we asked for written apology they were not ready to write. According to CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT the consumers should be compensated. We took all three important steps according to law. 1. Immediately complain, 2. Take pictures, 3. Have a reasonable complain. Ans inspire of all this no compensation was given. We stayed in room 425. We payed the total bill and only then checked out. -dr. Vinay and dr.

"Poor as it can be, not a 5 star","3","2025-11","2025-11-10","At Ramada Jaipur, I took my chance,
Hoping for comfort, a warm welcome glance.
But coldness reigned in every space,
Reception and restaurant—a frosty place.
Three or four stars? They claim the gleam,
But service felt like a forgotten dream.
No warmth, no smiles, just rigid rules,
Turns out the charm was lost in the fools.
White towels marked with yellow stains,
Left doubts of hygiene, lingering remains.
Brajesh at reception—rude and slow,
Turning short waits into marathons, you know.
If poor hospitality’s your craving spree,
This is your stop, as bleak as can be.

"Left within an hour","1","2025-09","2025-10-12","Upon arrival we checked in via a not very friendly receptionist, no details about the hotels facilities and not a particularly warm welcome.
Once in our ‘Club Room’ a charming staff member brought up our suitcases.
We went to explore the hotel, the pool area is in need of attention, pigeons were having a dip in the pool.
The gym was not clean. On asking a member of staff to turn on the air on he said it was not his department but then turned it on. The whole rooftop bar / swimming pool area was so unwelcoming.
We returned to our room, and on closer inspection that too was not clean. Toilet needed cleaning, toilet roll had black marks all over it, carpet stained, desk has two large burn type marks etc.
All of this was confirmed when the Hotel Manager personally came to our room on hearing that we were leaving. He both saw and agreed with the issues we had raised. He offered an alternative room for us, but we declined. If this promotes itself as a 4 Star hotel then Ramada need to get a grip of management as they are not checking on the basics.

The value of this hotel was exceptional. The hotel was also very clean and met all of our expectations. The hotel is located off a main road so road noise was not much of an issue. The breakfast provided was also good, although we did not find there too be that many options.

"Dont be fooled by th ename Palace, its not even a close to a motel !!","2","2023-08","2023-08-20","I stayed at this hotel with my family of 8 and it was the worst decision ever. They accused us of stealing a hand towel (by the way which is used piece of junk), asked us to open our bags and check and made us pay 120 rupees after we made a bill of 75K. The restaurant food was really bad and delivered the items after 30-40 min of ordering. Even if the rooms are available, they won’t let you do early check in even if you pay extra (I requested them very politely as my wife is pregnant, but still denied). Talking about the room, it’s below quality. No hot water and the towels are like super used and had bad stains. The fridge in the room is useless and it does not work at all. One more thing, if the place has a palace tag it does not mean it’s a palace. It looks new from outside but it’s super old from inside. The blankets, bed sheets, beds and all the other things are worn out and dirty. Don’t get fooled with their sweet greetings and faces. Their intentions and service are really bad.

"Toller Aufenthalt (nice stay)","4","2023-03","2023-04-16","Die Zimmer sind sehr schön gestaltet, haben eine tolle Ausstattung und sind sauber. Das Personal ist nett und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer im 3.OG sind leider recht hellhörig, man bekommt das Abendprogramm auf der Dachterasse deutlich mit. Da das Programm 22 Uhr endet, ist es vermutlich typsache, ob es einen stört. Uns wurde sofort ein Zimmertausch angeboten, als wir dies an der Rezeption bemerkten. Insgesamt war es ein wirklich schöner und empfehlenswerter Aufenthalt.

The rooms are designed very thoughtfully, the amenities are all well kept and the rooms are very clean. The hotel staff was helpful and considerate. During the evening show on the rooftop, the rooms below (on the third level) are a bit noisy. One can hear what is going on upstairs, but they stay within the show timings (10 pm). When we complained about this they immediately offered us rooms on a different floor. Overall it was a pleasant stay and we can recommend this hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r886426710-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452391289","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1200","1","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinakU9912TY","Martina","199E07C2C86C93A89693D129F8914C56",,,,,"martinakU9912TY",,,,,,,,"D-194, Jagdish Marg, Banipark, Jaipur 302016 India","Jaipur","India","302016","Rajasthan","D-194, Jagdish Marg, Banipark",,"1138118","26.925457","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80113","Laxmi Palace Heritage Boutique Hotel","642","4.2","30","25","71","159","357","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d1138118-Reviews-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://www.laxmipalacehotel.com"

"Buen hotel pero con detalles a mejorar. ","5","2023-01","2023-02-22","Estaba todo muy limpio, ordenado y en buen estado. Los trabajadores atendieron muy bien en todo momento. Localización cercana a la parada de metro y en transporte privado a 10 minutos del Hawa Mahal.

El último día la ducha dejó de echar agua caliente pero como teníamos prisa tampoco pudimos parar a quejarnos.

En la terraza tenían una zona restaurante con espectáculos de danza y música típicas de la zona. Pero éstos pasaban más tiempo pidiendo propinas que tocando y a medida que avanzaba la noche perdían el interés y las ganas. ¡Ni en nuestro propio hotel pudimos huir del acoso de dar propinas!

Además, el primer día no nos limpiaron la habitación porque no nos avisaron de que había que dejar las llaves antes de salir del hotel.

"The worst experience ever","1","2022-11","2023-01-29","So we booked our staying in this hotel through agoda.com. we chose to pay for our staying after we will check out. when we checked out at first they said that we dont need to pay any money, so I have signed in the papers and we were ready to left the hotel, when after a couple of minutes the manager called my name and told us that there was a mistake, and we need to pay 12000 rupees. And its not for food, not for drinks or something else. Just for staying. So we paid. In cash of course. They didnt gave us any check, or any papers. Because we didnt know if that was necessary. When we came home, back to Lithuania, we saw on our bank account, that agoda took from us 140 euros. We immediatly contacted both agoda and hotel. Agoda was the first one who took our money, so it means that we dont need to pay to hotel. The hotel is not answering already two months. Our family called them, and now they saying that we paid for food, and drinks. But we never eated at the hotel, never ordered any food to our room. Then we were drinking at the bar, we always paid in cash after we finish our drinks. Theres everywhere cameras which can prove that. So I guess manager just decided to use us, although we always leaved good tips after every help we needed. Still waiting for a problem solution, if not, we will just go to police. Its a shame that we cant fly to India again, because its too far, because than we can ask for cameras records. Tables, chairs, bed sheetings, everything was dirty. Some people of the staff was really helpful and sincere, but other ones, I dont have any words.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r876833806-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"450","459781107","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/67/b3/f3/caption.jpg","450","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karolinamM7230LH","Karolina M","4DF98872FE8929AE759979C1942014D6",,"887218","Ukmerge, Lithuania","Ukmerge","karolinamM7230LH",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

"Average stay not worth the money","3","2022-12","2022-12-28","Cons :

There is water dripping all day at a tap in the bathroom, the shower fuzzes and makes noise. We had to change rooms and waste half a day there after check-in.

An untidy room with lots of dust on the floor is what we got. Dimensions were not as described.

There is no ventilation in the washroom due to which there is discomfort after using it.

There were cockroaches everywhere.

The swimming pool was not accessible as there were private functions arranged.

The bath towels were pathetic. Cloth bobble remains on the body and clothes after usage. We had to use the roller to remove them later.

There was no mirror in the room, We had to use the one from the washroom.

Pros :

Near to the bus stand. And ease to access to local transport.

Near to all tourist attractions.

The food / Restaurant is good.

The hospitality of the staff is nice and welcoming.

"STAY AWAY! IT IS A RUNNING SCAM!  Hyped room price, nothing in reality.","1","2022-12","2022-12-14","Possibly the worst stay I have ever experienced in my life! 

To begin with, during Check-in the receptionist could not find my booking and started claiming I have to pay extra as I was booking at 3 AM. While for that particular reason I had booked my stay one day prior and on the day of booking. This took us almost 35-40 min at the reception standing, explaining him. 

Do not expect anyone to assist you to your room, and on reaching room you would be left for a quiz to find the main power switch. Which is freaking outside! 

We were staying in apparently ‘executive’ room. There was absolutely nothing executive about it but a cheap motel room. I cannot believe they are charging so much for the room. There is no functional AC in the room, just a noise that it is ON. No, Wifi or atleast our ‘executive’ room was not in the vicinity of the router. The staff was kind enough to reply ‘ Sir what can we do if you are not in the vicinity!’ To top it off, bathrooms are old, leaky, and without proper hygiene. 

Next morning, we requested for a room change where we could atleast have a working AC and Wifi. They said it is fully booked and showed us even worser room to which we decided to stay in the original one. 

In the room there is a bottle of water to invite you, but it is not sealed! As the room service said and quote ‘ bhaiya it is from R.O., apko mineral water chahiye to chargeable hoga’ WHAT? 😤 Nevertheless, we ordered one bottle of water and guess the price of it was ? 50 rupees!

Insanely pathetic experience and would never recommend to anybody!!! 

Let’s not be so cruel, good things: 

Good bed with white sheets! 🙂","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r871762977-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452391715","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg","1200","2","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/554virajd","Viraj D","F00E2D20B9EDEB265D7B6EA595220AE1",,"187393","Mainz, Germany","Mainz","554virajd",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

"Pathetic hotel+not recommended+waste of money","1","2022-10","2022-10-04","thing it takes around 1:30hr to them send in room. And that to u have to call them twice because when i first time place order then don’t communication to further then when get fade up and call where is my food they ohh give us some time will send soon. 
And most surprising thing they charge 100m milk of Rs.90 and before booking when i call they said for infants milk is complimentary.
And that to provide 100ml milk they took 2hr. And I have to call them 3 times.
Floor filled with cigarettes smell and bath room no towels and tape wanter continually drip and no water drainage piper block and when took bath water will don’t pass.
Food what ever gravy u order they have same taste only the charges are different.
At the same price you have very good hotel and if don’t want regret later never considering this hotel at least is you are going with family.

Also, they said the pick and drop with in 3 km they provide and when i requested can they provide me drop to railway station they said you can take out from out side and its just 1.3km from hotel","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r863120316-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452387345","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg","1200","1","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anand_Joshi05","Anand Joshi","79C00C2EE5B1EFD2B996DD080CC34496",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Anand_Joshi05",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

"Groped by drunk staff member in broad day light ","1","2020-03","2020-03-10","Arrived back to the hotel at around 12pm after a morning celebrating holi festival with my boyfriend. Outside the hotel were around 5 members of staff including the manager that took us to our room a few days earlier and checked us in. They were all clearly drunk and started asking us for a photo with them. We were happy to have a photo with them but as soon as I smiled for the photo one of them grabbed my breast and when I slapped his hand off and told him no, he did it again! My boyfriend was furious - but he simply didn’t see there was a problem and followed us to the door asking for more photos. The manager and other staff members did and said nothing and so I didn’t feel comfortable complaining directly to the hotel, especially as none of them spoke very clear English for quite a sensitive matter! Will attempt to complain through tripadvisor and Agoda who I booked through but feel that nothing will be done about the matter. I can only hope that lone women travellers read this before staying with this hotel.

"False advertising! Filthy","1","2025-11","2025-11-04","Pool area is a joke. False advertising on the Radisson website. They show a beautiful pool area and well furnished rooms however the reality is very different. Scruffy, dirty and nothing like the pictures. 
We complained about the state of the place however were met with contempt and denial. There is something very very wrong at this hotel with staffing, service and hygiene and cleanliness it is shocking. Don’t go to this hotel it is run down and a health hazard. 
Supposed to be 5 star, I wouldn’t give it 2 stars.
Pictures are of the pool area which show bird droppings all over the bar area, rusty fridges and derelict pool furniture and a pool that is so filthy that I would t get in if they paid me .
Rooms were scruffy with mismatched bedding, stains in bathroom that could easily be cleaned, dust everywhere, damp sheets, bird crap all over windows,  rubble inside the wire holes, dirty telephone and lighting pad that we didn’t want to touch as they were all sticky. 
Horrible experience that totally ruined our stay in Jaipur.
Management were useless and don’t seem to see the dirty state of the place, either they are in denial or they are very scared and feel intimidated by the top management,","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d3801241-r1037779043-Radisson_Blu_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1566","725645234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/40/77/b2/caption.jpg","2048","2","26","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angien912","Angie N","50C0F08A278989A0FDD487A791165E62",,"672812","Finestrat, Spain","Finestrat","angien912",,,,,,,,"Plots No. 5 And 6 Airport Plaza, Tonk Road, Durgapura Jai Jawan-2, Choti Chopad, Chandrakala Colony, Durgapura, Jaipur 302018 India","Jaipur","India","302018","Rajasthan","Plots No. 5 And 6 Airport Plaza, Tonk Road, Durgapura","Jai Jawan-2, Choti Chopad, Chandrakala Colony, Durgapura","3801241","26.84252","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.7941","Radisson Blu Jaipur","4147","4.4","217","125","320","776","2718","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d3801241-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/radisson-blu-jaipur?cid=a:se+b:yex+c:apac+i:local+e:rdb+d:ind+f:en-us+h:inrjjai1"

"AVOID unless you want to be ill","1","2025-11","2025-11-03","Shocking service, dirty a health hazard AVOID!

We stayed here in this supposed 5star hotel as a couple. On arrival at the hotel I noticed it was very dirty, lots of dust and fingerprints everywhere like it hadn’t been cleaned for months.
We booked a King Business class room and were allocated a room on 6th floor overlooking the road. It was also very dirty with coffee stains next to the bed and rusting lamps, dirty bathroom and bird crap all over the windows and ledges. We were then moved to 724 which was pretty much the same, dirty. When I asked for the bathroom to be cleaned they simply sprayed some air freshener and left. The safe didn’t work and they just said sorry about that! 
The best part was when we decided to visit the pool area on the rooftop to relax after sightseeing in Jaipur. OMG this is a complete health hazard with pigeon droppings everywhere, a pool that has not been cleaned for months and a bar that looked derelict.We went to reception to complain and asked them about the pictures they were advertising on the website that were absolutely nothing like what we were seeing.
We were met with two managers housekeeping and a duty manager who simply said they were sorry to hear about our disappointment and left us in the lobby whilst they went to investigate for over 30mins.
They then retuned to say they had put 2 subbed at the pool for us. However as I considered it to be a health hazard I shared that we would not be visiting again only to take photos of the place.I also at this point showed the housekeeping manager all the dust under the tables and he just laughed!
They offered me a 10% discount on food and drinks I had in the bar, I already had this as a Platinum member of the Radisson club and shared that as the hotel was so dirty I had decided to eat and drink elsewhere. Very poor service from management who seemed weak and ineffective with little knowledge of how to deal with complaints or customer service issues. 
As I was complaining another guest in the lobby shouted to the manager that she also agreed with everything I had said and that she had been suffering with damp sheets, no fridge and an allergic reaction since she checked in here.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d3801241-r1037662740-Radisson_Blu_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452389216","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg","1200","0","21","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z9290TRangien","Angie N","574A88125C4232E8F9AAE4A3ACC56A9B",,,,,"Z9290TRangien",,,,,,,,"Plots No. 5 And 6 Airport Plaza, Tonk Road, Durgapura Jai Jawan-2, Choti Chopad, Chandrakala Colony, Durgapura, Jaipur 302018 India","Jaipur","India","302018","Rajasthan","Plots No. 5 And 6 Airport Plaza, Tonk Road, Durgapura","Jai Jawan-2, Choti Chopad, Chandrakala Colony, Durgapura","3801241","26.84252","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.7941","Radisson Blu Jaipur","4147","4.4","217","125","320","776","2718","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d3801241-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/radisson-blu-jaipur?cid=a:se+b:yex+c:apac+i:local+e:rdb+d:ind+f:en-us+h:inrjjai1"

Despite placing an order for two omelettes, they never arrived. The buffet counters were in complete disarray — no bowls, no glasses, no sambar, no poori, no cups, and even the milk pot was empty.

For a property of this standard, such negligence and lack of management are unacceptable.

"Horrible experience at Radisson Blu","1","2025-10","2025-10-23","This was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had at a so-called five-star property.  The first room allotted stank of dampness and stale air. The second room wasn’t any better no electricity, no hot water, and no coffee sachets. When I tried to reach housekeeping by dialing 0, there was no response at all.

The breakfast was an absolute mess no plates, no cutlery, empty food trays, and it took an hour to get a cappuccino. The spa was terrible no hair dryer, the massage oil was cold, and there was no soft music, and the steam room had no light completely ruining the experience. The pool was in horrible condition, dirty, surrounded by pigeons and their droppings, with no shade or proper pool chairs, just tarps thrown over them.

The food itself was good and the restaurant staff were polite, but everything else front office, housekeeping, and maintenance was a disaster. This property desperately needs a management overhaul.

"Very Disappointing Stay – Not Worth the Money","1","2025-09","2025-09-05","Very Disappointing Stay – Not Worth the Money

I had one of the worst hotel experiences during my stay here.
	•	The room was not clean – the bedsheet had stains, and the bathroom was not properly maintained. Even the shower tap was not working.
	•	We had booked the MAP plan, but there were no starters in the buffet. Starters had to be ordered and paid for separately. The dinner food was also served cold.
	•	The staff was unfriendly and did not seem interested in assisting guests, which made the experience even more unpleasant.

Overall, I found the hotel poorly managed and not guest-friendly. Definitely not a place I would recommend or return to.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1027166-r1028908045-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452389098","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1200","0","29","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resort61879567536","Arvind Jain","8CFCE36146FB37ED9AC85284356151D5",,"297608","Ahmedabad, India","Ahmedabad","Resort61879567536",,"General Manager","1036765765","en","2025-10-28","Kunal Baveja","Dear Guest,

"Clean but noisy","2","2022-09","2022-10-06","Whilst there were some positives to this hotel such as it was clean, had a good location and good food (and excellent restaurant staff), I would probably not recommend staying here. 

I experienced an extremely noisy hotel. One particularly frustrating night, a member of staff was sanding the paint on the walls outside my room (and other rooms) at 9:30pm at night. When I tried to communicate with the staff that it was loud and preventing me from sleeping, staff were dismissive and said that it would continue until at least 10:30pm. Not sure why this maintenance was not carried out during the daytime so as not to disturb the guests.  

Definitely not worth the amount paid for zero sleep.

"Beautiful boutique hotel but not great service","3","2022-07","2022-08-09","The property is of a 3 star standard rather than 4 star. We had booked the Suite but my kids were bitten at night by mosquitoes quite a lot. We later realised the mosquito repellant in the room was empty. This should have been checked prior to check in.

Service at restaurant was a little abrupt and rude. I ordered a tea one night but it was 45 minutes and it still did not arrive. When i said i would like to cancel it as my kids were tired and needed to get them to bed (it was at 10.30pm) they refused to cancel, so i had to leave but they still charged me for it in my final bill. I couldnt be asked to argue about a cup of tea payment, but it just showed a shoddy service.

Also on The final morning we had a flight so had to leave the hotel 15 mins before breakfast time started and had requested if we could have a small packed breakfast for my kids but was straight out refused , as they said breakfast starts at 6.30pm (we requested to get a small packed breakfast for the kids at 6.15am!) So despite us paying for a room with inclusive breakfast we were not able to avail it in our final morning. Its just these little things that the hotel lacked in- customer service.

Eventhough the property is beautiful, i would not recommend it to my family and friends as was slightly let down by the service.

"Best hotel have ever stayed","5","2022-05","2022-05-07","We had an amazing stay, the hotel is situated in a quiet area and has a pool, both being more than welcomed when visiting buzzing Jaipur in a very hot day. The room was big, clean and the room service and food were both really great. The staff was amazingly helpful and kind, helped us organize the rest of our trip and generally made our stay relaxing and enjoyable thanks to their attention. I highly recommend Laxmi Palace, and would definitely come back there. You also have some tuktuk drivers waiting a bit further from the hotel, we took some and they were great, saving you from going to the main road where it's crazier. Everything in and around for a hassle-free stay.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r837579470-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452388198","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yadvendra900","Yadvendra","D36FD95398F897A3272DAB9C67328159",,,,,"yadvendra900",,"General Manager","840446116","en","2022-05-28","Laxmi Palace Heritage Boutique Hotel","Dear Guest,

"very hopeless. overpriced. no facility. no wifi even. no staff courtsey. unhygienic rooms and washrooms. very congested","2","2025-08","2025-08-19","DO NOT book! Pathetic hotel!!! Hopeless. 

However, some of the staff disappointed us. They lacked basic courtsey. They start arguing and are almost on the verge of back answering every time u speak to them even politely. reception desk is not at all welcoming. too crowded. dining area is just besides the entrance and reception and it is completely open. no privacy. hospitality is very poor in the hotel. there are mosquitoes in the room. the towels nd the bedsheet were stinking. despite requests, the management doesnt help much. the wifi is PATHETIC!!! and when u complain about it to the reception, they say it is NOT OUR FAULT! The swimming pool firstly is on the terrace and is operational just till 6 PM- because the hotel wants to operate a poolside restaurant after 6PM. Even when I requested to allow me to use the pool after 6 Pm as i didnt mind the restaurant, they refused rudely. no manners. guests satisfaction is placed last. I had a good experience with Ramada By Wyndham in Chandigarh (Zirakpur) and so had booked this hotel but this particular hotel has let me down like anything. Will think a 100 times before booking again. Do NOT go here.

Just some staff members were good for example: Mr. Pankaj in the restaurant was very good. Mr. Sanjay ji (chef) was very humble and sweet as he made some good dishes when two members of our family didnt eat anything in the buffet. The restaurant manager Imran was also very cooperative. 
Ms. Mamta ji was also very co-operative.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1027166-r1025569302-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452391289","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAir17190365055","OnAir17190365055","CF70735049EDDD76ADD7D99310A9009B",,,,,"OnAir17190365055",,,,,,,,"Govind Marg Raja Park, Jaipur 302004 India","Jaipur","India","302004","Rajasthan","Govind Marg","Raja Park","1027166","26.89566","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.82883","Ramada by Wyndham Jaipur","3828","4.4","134","104","289","729","2572","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d1027166-Reviews-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://www.wyndhamhotels.com/ramada/jaipur-india/ramada-jaipur/overview"

"Very nice hotel but quite noisy","4","2020-02","2020-03-05","Stayed here for 2 nights in Feb 2020, the hotel itself is lovely, the decor is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and clean and the beds are comfortable. The staff are very accommodating and the restaurant food is pretty good. 

The breakfast buffet has quite a few options to choose from but don't expect the same kind of spread you would get in Europe/USA etc. Most of the food is Indian but fruit, cereal, bread, eggs are available. 

The one downside of this hotel was the noise. My room faced the main street and the traffic is super heavy from about 4am. In India, everyone beeps their horn, constantly, so the noise can be quite distracting if you're a light sleeper. 

If you plan to visit, maybe request a quiet room to avoid being woken up through the night. 

Other than that, I really enjoyed my stay here, the location is great! Would stay here again. 

Hope this helps!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r749208201-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"480","360571106","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/7d/e0/e2/jade-a.jpg","480","38","76","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/328jadea","Jade A","6532F4DBD9E201CDAF6A79BB785B0687",,"186534","Glasgow, United Kingdom","Glasgow","328jadea",,"Revenue Management","797770673","en","2021-07-17","Fort Chandragupt","Dear Sir,

"Poor internet, limited hot water, poor communication","3","2019-10","2019-10-08","The hotel staff were very kind to let us check in early on the day of our arrival. Do not expect a reply to requests for transport from the train station or airport, we sent 3 messages via the booking platform and got no response at all, luckily we had access to Uber. The internet is woeful, unable to even load the most basic of webpages in our room or in common areas eg the restaurant. We had to request that hot water be accessible in our room for showers and it was only just warm. The rooftop bar is non existent, just a space without seating and rubbish everywhere. The downstairs bar is dark and cash only, the staff eventually agreed to add the charge to our hotel bill. The included breakfast is ok, you can request eggs cooked to your liking. Bottled water was not provided. The TV is very limited with most channels not available, especially the English speaking ones.The location is ok but be aware you will be hassled by tuk tuk drivers the minute you step out the door, admittedly this is normal for India. Overall, if this hotel wants to attract international travellers some improvements need to be made as the advertised inclusions are not what is advertised on platforms such as Agoda and Booking.com.

"Luxury Under Budget","5","2019-09","2019-09-26","We stayed here for a night on Saturday, with all my company friends, this is a heritage property of near about 40 years old very near to Bus Station, as per GM of the property Mr. Bhupender, property is just recently renovated that's why room seems very luxury and new. This hotel got all the features like Multicuisne restaurant, Swimming Pool, Bar, Spa, banquet, a huge Terrace with a splendid view of forts. A good combination of all amenities in Avery limited budget. I like this hotel very much, and will suggest all my relatives, family and friends, who all want to visit Jaipur, must stay here for a night.

Thanks alot for all the courtesies.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r713260877-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,,,,,"0","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aniltoursharma","Anil Sharma","E114FA17AB64AD54CEA5E115B5E70329",,,,,"Aniltoursharma",,"Revenue Management","797800194","en","2021-07-18","Fort Chandragupt","Dear Sir,

You can pay by credit card here, but the manager pushes for cash. Just say no cash.

Room ok 

Avoid ... Exodus use this hotel on tours. They really need to improve the quality of there hotels.  I would not recommend the tour group or the hotel.

Breakfast wasn't too good to blab about but eggs omlete puri-bhaji idli+vada and sambar was served .

Service was a big issue , each request was to be repeated twice to get. Wifi password was made available after 2 hours after second request. A simple request for replacement of glass had to follow the bureaucract channel as the waiter refused to comply with same and insisted we call reception to send the housekeeping staff to do the needful.

"Below average stay","3","2018-06","2018-06-16","Was here last week for 5 nights.Although the overall review for this hotel was not good,I still thought of giving it a try and booked suite room.The hotel staff is normal, neither friendly nor rude. The location is a very plus point, next to central bus stand and in a busy area, and close to the old city. getting rickshaws and taxis is very much easy with a prepaid rickshaw counter nearby. The room is below average old style one, with centralized AC, which doesnt cool to the extent required. the ceiling was licking due to AC condensation. Fridge was ok. bathroom is good. no toiletry provided, only shampoo and cream. there is no faucet pipe in the toilet.lifts, reception is all good. Food is tasty and nice in their restaurant, and so was the complimentary breakfast, but the prices for dishes are higher and costly i felt. Coudnt use the pool as it was closed for all the days I was in there. Pool timings are 7AM-7PM. bed and sofas has damp smell, but manageable.The hotel staff is old styled and should adjust to the new concepts of hospitality.

"With better management this hotel could be truly average","2","2018-03","2018-03-26","First some positives. The rooms are a decent size and the beds are comfortable, from the outside the building is impressive as indeed are the communual areas. But the negatives outweigh these factors. The rooms we were given were quite shabby and had not been deep cleaned for a long time. Neither the bath nor  the wash basin came with a plug and like the hair dryer were only obtained after repeated requests. More seriously the hotel does not supply free bottled water in the rooms; there was a report within our group that the water purchased came in refilled bottles not unopened ones. Lastly it seems about 30% of items on the a la carte menu cannot be supplied. Overall suggestion is to avoid this one if you can.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r568924136-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1920","102082674","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/15/a8/72/brucie243.jpg","2560","69","58","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brucie243","Brucie243","06A88E22DD8AA2821943B281FE54BEBC",,,,,"Brucie243",,"Revenue Management","798012251","en","2021-07-19","Fort Chandragupt","Dear Sir,

"Good budget hotel","3","2018-01","2018-01-28","3.5/5.
Hotel is big & nice but they don't have some basic amenities due to that i cant say that this is perfect choice.
They don't have Tea/coffee maker in room.
Washroom tap was leaking.
Breakfast menu was dull.

Rooms were good & spacious. best thing is they have Bath tub in room.
They have beautiful pool as well. This is good budget property.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r557023437-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"574","233465640","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/ea/67/28/gaureshsingh.jpg","574","28","54","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaureshsingh","Gaureshsingh","77657FC9BC38112C9BFDA7777F3A8635",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Gaureshsingh",,"Revenue Management","798600816","en","2021-07-20","Fort Chandragupt","Dear Sir,

"We're not planning to visit again anytime soon ","2","2017-12","2017-12-19","The rooms are clean and well presented however, we were unhappy with this hotel for many reasons. The bus depot is right outside the hotel so you have announcements going from very early morning so best to ask for a room at the back of the hotel. We booked and paid for 3 rooms to occupy 11 guests and on departure were asked to pay for an extra 3 beds. The restaurant never ever gave us the right change, we ended up having to demand the correct change. This happened everytime We dined except for room service. 
I put some washing in and marked on the form clearly what I sent, they made changes without any consultation as per their form and charged more. Our overall stay as a family was not great. I will say however that house keeping staff were friendly and helpful.

The shower dripped badly and the plumping was very noisy.  But after reporting to reception this was resolved and improved the next day, although toilet still got wet.

"Convenient For Bus/Train","3","2016-12","2016-12-01","We were only in town for one night travelling by train so this was a convenient location.  Unfortunately it is situated in a dirty busy part of town so there is not really any other location appeal other than proximity to bus / train stations.  We arrived very early in the morning so it was nice that they made our room available on our arrival.   However the room had a distinct and unpleasant smell to it.  The wall had a switch for AC but nothing to modulate the temperature.  We had a bath tub for those who like to have one, not really a big deal to me.  Generally clean and service was ok with an ok breakfast.  Staff do not speak English very well.  A functional hotel with little charm.

We organized a day conference on behalf of Nestlé at Ramada Hotel, Raja Park, Jaipur on 29th July. We opted for the lunch in the outdoor area, and I must say, the food was absolutely fantastic.

Special compliments to the Palak Paneer, Red Thai Curry, Chicken Korma, Dal Dhaba, and Dum Aloo Bhojpuri – everything was delicious and truly appreciated by our entire team.

I, Satyam, was the coordinator for this day conference, and I’m extremely satisfied with the overall arrangements. A special thanks to Chef Rajendra, the Executive Chef of the hotel, whose warm behavior and cooperation made our experience even better. He ensured that the food was prepared exactly as we requested, which speaks volumes about his professionalism and commitment.

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Chef Rajendra and the entire Ramada Raja Park Jaipur team. I look forward to coming back again for future events.

"Skip staying at Ramada by Wyndham","1","2025-07","2025-07-20","The stay at Wyndham has gone from bad to worse with the hospitality equivalent of a Third Grade Hotel

There was no welcome at checkin neither the luggage was escorted further the receptionist was callous and rude unaware of Wyndham rewards Diamond status

The Room 219 allotted was stinking bad from the smell of liquor and smoking so I had to change the Room to 218

There was no bathing liquid soap for 2 days and the housekeeping didn’t replenish until the 3rd day

The In-room dining menu is extremely limited with no local delicacy

The breakfast was limited with fewer options compared to similar Ramada Hotels in India

The receptionist was reduce and callous and refused for Late Checkout.

The Hotel Manager Deepak was equally Callous and defensive when given with the feedback and refused to take it.

This is my last stay in a Wyndham property in India and I’ll stick to Marriott and Radisson you guys cannot match them.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1027166-r1019671602-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"450","54075610","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/39/20/da/v1vek.jpg","450","76","159","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JugaduTraveler","Vivek","915989F7A64ACD501382220D318BD300",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","JugaduTraveler",,,,,,,,"Govind Marg Raja Park, Jaipur 302004 India","Jaipur","India","302004","Rajasthan","Govind Marg","Raja Park","1027166","26.89566","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.82883","Ramada by Wyndham Jaipur","3828","4.4","134","104","289","729","2572","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d1027166-Reviews-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://www.wyndhamhotels.com/ramada/jaipur-india/ramada-jaipur/overview"

De kamers zijn zeer mooi, typisch Indisch. Wel mogen ze de vloer eens stofzuigen want die is zanderig, ook hangt er een muffe geur in de kamer. Voor de rest is de badkamer wel wat verouderd en kan een opknapbeurt gebruiken. Omdat het hotel niet bij een drukke straat ligt, heb je hier geen last van lawaai en kan je goed slapen. Het ontbijt valt wel mee, als je een omelet wil, kan je die altijd vragen aan de vriendelijke obers. Al bij al een goed hotel.

"A really bad experience","1","2016-07","2016-07-21","This hotel is incredibly overpriced for the provided services. We only paid half price because of an online offer but even then the price is way overrated even for India. The swimming pool is closed, no hot water, no wifi in the rooms and only in some places and sometimes in the hotel lobby (we were told that we were ""lucky"" not to pay 550 Rs per day for a wifi that does not even exist...). There was water coming out of the toilets, quickly drowning the bathroom. We asked to change rooms as soon as we arrived because it was way too dirty, and the new room was a little bigger but just as dirty. It was really late so we finally went to bed. After all that, we asked to pay less than the initial price and we were (not so) kindly asked to simply check out. 
The breakfast was a buffet which was good, with Indian food and the staff really nice and dedicated to us.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r395320157-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"50","172486106","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/47/ed/da/paul-w.jpg","50","2","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulwltr321","Paul","52BEA6BEA550559E240D934BA8082C38",,,,,"paulwltr321",,"Owner","401283075","en","2016-08-04","FORT_CHAND","Dear Guest,

We are concerned regarding the shortcomings you highlighted , which are being taken up with the concerned associates in order to take corrective measures for the future.

Due to erractic monsoons in July we had to close the pool.We regret the fact that the room and the bathroom was not up to the standard you had expected from us . We will put in more efforts in fulfilling the gap that guest expect from us. 

Also the wi-fi works but sometimes there is a failure from the telecom provider.

"An average hotel that needs a lot of improvement.","2","2016-06","2016-06-27","We arrived at the hotel.  I'll mention from the front it opens up to a sketchy area in Jaipur.  Upon arrival, we were treated rudely by customer service.  They acted as if they didn't want us to stay.  Then, they only gave us one room even though we had already paid for two.  After reminding them with the receipt we printed out beforehand, they gave us two rooms.  Our rooms were dirty, and had mold on the walls.  My bathroom wasn't clean, and there was no shower curtain.  Enjoy using the toilet in your shower puddles.  Worst of all, the toilet had remaining """"material"""" from whomever last used it on the toilet ring and I had to clean it myself.  This isn't an attack on the hotel, but just an outline of things they can definitely improve in the future as well as a forewarning to future guests.

"Not too bad","4","2016-01","2016-02-16","This hotel is pretty centrally based for getting about and restaurants are all within walking distance. 
The shop two doors up sell beautiful saris but the shop in the hotel not only changes your currency at a good rate but they sell stunning saris and gifts at a cheaper price than shops around. Unusual for a hotel shop but trust me it's worth a visit.
The bar in the basement however is a must to avoid. Locals smoking in a dark large room looking at you like your from mars. Expensive too. My advice would be visit an alcohol shop on your way back from being out and about. A tuk tuk will always be willing to help out.

         I had inquired about the Check-in where I came across the facts that your booking  had been cancelled by yourself ten days back  but you had showed up. Our team in order to accommodate you as it was a full house on that day might have taken a little long in check you in which I apologise for.
        
           Also the wi-fi has weak signals in some rooms which we are working on as it is a heritage hotel but I hope you didn’t have problems in the room which we transferred you later too. 

In the interim, please feel free to write to me on md@fortchandagupt.com  should you need to share any other comments that will help us make your stay experience an impeccable one.

Finally I gave up, and got it from the market. The GM of the hotel Mr.PuranSingh, was more than apologetic and wanted to makeup for the bad experience, but at times I get irritated beyond compromise levels.

We were greeted on arrival with drinks and floral chains with a woman putting tikkas on our forehead which was a nice touch.
I went in the pool for about 20 minutes one afternoon - that was about all I could stand. It wasn't very clean!
The location of the hotel was spot on, very close to the pink city and just a short tuk tuk ride from most places of interest (the amber fort is a little way away).
The bar is nice inside or you can sit outside on the grass next to the water feature - don't expect great table service though, you'll be waiting a while!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r303123870-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beno530","Ben O","CC7AB1B98AE2CDA19803B8A73E619CD5",,,,,"beno530",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

"Was likely once a really fine hotel","2","2015-05","2015-05-28","The hotel has very charming gates upon approach and a nice courtyard. The staff greated us with drinks and made us feel very welcome in a lobby that exudes the style of hotels of the past (large/marble). There is a shop in the lobby that sells reasonably priced low end tourist gear. The public bathrooms in this hotel are horrible though and speak to the larger issues with the hotel. That is, the hotel  appears nicer than it is due to the marble work of the hotel. The rooms are large but the furnishings have seen better days and could certainly use dusting and replacement. My room looked out on the busy bus terminal area but the windows were covered wtih filth and pigeon droppings on the outside. As for amenities, massages are quite inexpensive and good at this place and the restauarant's chef was very gracious. The pool area is attractive but the water has the stench of sewer so I wouldn't recommend a swim in it.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r275260496-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452389795","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","1200","61","53","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meleetyme","meleetyme","B03820AA894FF00E9603A24B4FC51EF9",,,,,"meleetyme",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

"Not a pleasant one","3","2025-09","2025-09-12","Buffet spread was not great
Just three  juices - only one was a  fresh one. Twice I had breakfast  yesterday it was almost  a semi stale water melon juice and today it was a similar mixed fruit juice. Look like they used yesterday's unused cut fruits and made a juice  

I reported to the restaurant manager, he has promise to give me a fresh orange juice now. I'm writing this sitting in the restaurant   (13/09/2025)

Today morning I asked for an iron box   The room had an ironing  table but no iron box. (The ironing table was dirty- I have shared its picture here) The lady in the front office, ask my room number and my name, and cut the line without even telling me if she's sending inbox.  
I called again, a gentleman picked up this time, (I understand the earlier ladies name was Himani from him), I told him about my experience. He apologised and promised to send me an iron box, which of course came after 15 minutes.  

I may not like to stay in this Radisson Blu again  
Dear administration, 
I know it is not easy, to make it good for the customer. Customers are of various stripes. 
But I am sure, you can try to make it better
(Eg: A little bit of gentlemess and pleasantness training to people like Himani)
All the best","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d3801241-r1030103365-Radisson_Blu_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"3240","55938916","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/55/8f/64/justinpaul.jpg","4320","8","33","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justinpaul","Justinpaul","A54D0F528FA909019E0FB8DF572B724F",,"10745344","Chennai District, India","Chennai District","Justinpaul",,"Guest Services / Front Office","1032946625","en","2025-10-01","Front Office Manager","Dear Guest,

"Absolutely terrible. ","1","2025-09","2025-09-12","The Radisson Blu, Jaipur was terribly disappointing.  The hotel is in desperate need of renovation.

Inside the room, the floor was damaged, furniture old and musty, electrical fittings not working, kettle was stinking and there was no hot water in thre bathroom. I mean, you name it.

Le camere erano assolutamente inaccettabili, ce ne hanno fatte vedere tre ( Suite essendo un cliente premium), ma tutte era umide e freddissime. Il sistema do condizionamento non funzionava a causa delle piogge?? Il probema è che tutte avevanp un odore di muffa ed umiditá stagnante, i divani, le lenzuola i cuscini il pavemento erano bagnati... il problema era che sopra una certa temperatura, 18 gradi!!!  il condizionamento fermava la deumidificazio e tutto si impregnava di umidità insana.

"Poor experience at radison blu","1","2025-08","2025-08-23","During checkout, I was charged for extra snacks that I did not consume. I had clearly informed the staff about the snacks I actually had, and I paid for those without any issue. However, they insisted on charging me for other items I never touched. It felt as though they did not trust my word, which was very disappointing.

As a guest who willingly acknowledged and paid for what I consumed, I find it unreasonable to be questioned over a small amount (₹150) when I had booked a full room at your property. This experience left a poor impression, as I value honesty and expected the same from the hotel staff.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d3801241-r1026333216-Radisson_Blu_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452390771","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarAway42024593138","FarAway42024593138","00D2A7F7182BE7EAF8755642A77C507C",,,,,"FarAway42024593138",,"Guest Services / Front Office","1026956680","en","2025-08-26","Front Office Manager","Dear Guest,

"Good Hotel, Average Service","4","2015-01","2015-01-29","This is an unbiased review.
The hotel location might not be good (being its proximity to bus stand) but it is helpful for people who need to catch buses/volvo without any hassle.
The exteriors needs some work but the interiors are well maintained. The room 211 which I was alloted is a nice room with pool view. The interiors are nice and has everything one need while staying.
The room and toilet was clean however the towels need to be replaced as they seems to be overused.
The bed makes a lotta nice and needs to be repaired so that one can sleep quietly. The mattress is good.
In a nutshell, my advise for travellers - this is good for a budget traveller and you can go for it. The advise of hotel management is - You have a good property and a good system. Just invest more in the service and staff. Train them well so that service can be made quick.

Rest all like food and restaurant is nice. However the variety in the breakfast is a little limited.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r251594946-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"912","137145573","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/2c/ac/e5/faaducritik.jpg","912","12","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FaaduCritik","Raj","3442EA7599619691E1D6429F977141ED",,"644043","Noida, India","Noida","FaaduCritik",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

"I'd bring that special someone here","5","2014-12","2015-01-20","We were three guys backpacking. We probably splashed out a bit here, because it isnt in a backpacker price range. It was nice staying in a smarter place for a change. Rooms were neat and clean, the bathroom was nice. 

One of the few places in India I didnt sleep in my sleeping bag, but slept in the hotel's bedding, and where I felt comfortable showering without flip-flops. 

The buffet breakfast was good. Always nice to have a solid meal before going out for the day. Theres an on-site bar and nice sitting areas in the foyer and outside at the back by the pool. 

It was December and cold, but I would have swam  in the pool, if it was warmer. The pool was so clean and tempting to dive in, but I guess it wasnt worth the pneumonia that would have followed.

The staff were friendly. The hotel is well located close to trains and buses. 

This doesnt seem like a big deal in other parts of the world, but in India, any establishment that accepts visa/mastercard is a plus in  my book, for the sheer convenience of it. And they dont charge extra because you paying by card (It is probably worked into the price I know, but it is nice that I didnt know that. Ignorance is bliss:) ) 

A thought that crossed my mind occasionally while visiting numerous budget hotels across India is, Would I stay here if I was travelling with that special someone? I would bring her here.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r250188486-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452388731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","25","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minty203","minty203","BCBF1B5C144DF7C2EFD6A71308565DD0",,"312578","Johannesburg, South Africa","Johannesburg","minty203",,"Owner","250484535","en","2015-01-22","FORT_CHAND","Dear Guest,

"Worth the price but 3* facilities ","3","2014-12","2014-12-29","Beside the Main Bus Station.
Standard room -  good.
Wash room - small.
Lots of hair around the wash room and room floor - did not expect for an 4* hotel.
After complaining , they have arranged to clean the room , but still not good - CLEAN WITH A CLEAN CLOTH.
Bed & Tv - good.
Best part  - Food - Great.
Staff at the restaurant - ok ( very un - professionalService ).
Spa - Good (30% - discount ) presently.
No free wifi  - ( 1 hour / 200 ₹ ), speed i am not sure how much is it.

Overall 4* hotel with purely 3* ,but worth the stay (Single)for the price.

"A decent budget hotel","3","2014-12","2014-12-28","A decent budget hotel located very close to the bus stand. The first impression might not be good as it is located in an extremely noisy and crowded area with metro construction right in front of it. It is not a heritage property. Only the exteriors are designed like that.

Rooms were quite spacious with decent bathrooms. But a tip here is to avoid staying on the first floor of the property as it also houses a conference room. There was a lot of noise with loud music being played till 11:30 in the night. The hotel staff couldn't do much even after complaining. 

The buffet breakfast is also just fine. All in all, a budget hotel which one can go to only if they are not spending much time at the hotel!","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r246291193-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"679","119786041","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/23/ca/39/tejaskashyap.jpg","679","41","51","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TejasKashyap","TejasKashyap","A23CBA52F954BD3212B5FC0103F2847B",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","TejasKashyap",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

The lunch when we arrived was terrible and overpriced so I didn't eat breakfast the following day.

He ask his colleges about but could not provide bed. they give pour bed to another customers for more money.Night Manager only blame Day manager to overbook the hotel. we clearly tell them that we don't pay for the extra beds because they don't provide the beds. after several arguments manger provide us double mattress. we have to manage both nights. at the time of checkout minus 500 rs only n our bill. food is good.if you are from Delhi then you have to travel thru city jam to reach hotel. it is far from most  monuments and places.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r232908225-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","16","65","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amit_gangania","amit_gangania","D97225D9BE7E59AAEAEBECFE520E5558",,,,,"amit_gangania",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

The location ensures that the shops around the hotel are open all night but it also means a lot a people and where there is crowd a lot of noise and a lot and a lot of litter follows. However the rooms have good sound proofing. The hotel is well maintained and clean.The restaurant and food were good with attentive staff. The rooms are spacious and relatively clean with decent bathroom. Hot water was always available. I had room facing the street but it was surprisingly quiet enough to sleep at night. The hotel is made like a Fort. The lobby and the common area are beautiful. They even have a small pool(it is very small). Overall a decent experience. I would say a good stay if you are on a budget.

"Well worth it","4","2014-06","2014-07-08","Stayed as part of a tour, so can't comment on the prices. The hotel lobby is fabulous, the rooms nice and tidy and the beds comfortable. They do charge for wi-fi, which is a downer. Service was very good.

I started my Delhi-Belly experience here, just after we arrived. I had got the bug in Delhi that morning. The front desk arranged for a doctor to visit me; he arrived in under half an hour, and was a charming middle-aged gentleman with an excellent bedside manner. I was charged 1,200 (about $20US) and this included the meds and re-hydration packets. He even sent one of the hotel staff to bring the meds to me directly, so I only waited an additional 15 minutes and didn't have to venture out to find a pharmacy. He was obviously proud of his home city, so we had a nice chat about what I ought to do on my free time: I wasn't about to let the bug deprive me. I'm glad I didn't spend the time in my room, as the TV offerings were few and all in Hindi.

There's an ATM a couple meters to the left as you exit the front door. 

The hotel is in a good location, despite the construction going on in the street. Would book there again if going back.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r214305892-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452392029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","48","87","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hastwokitties","Hastwokitties","4D72015A820AB61F4F7096AECDBF0812",,"297896","Galle, Sri Lanka","Galle","Hastwokitties",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

"Overpriced, Dodgy pricing and short changing","2","2014-01","2014-01-24","Stayed here 2 nights over New Year as part of a tour.  

First thing I noticed was that the prices were ridiculous.  Wifi was charged on a 24hr period whereas most places was free.  Laundry was expensive too but well done.  

Lots of confusion and chaos on the reception desk for a multiple of reasons. Seemed grumpy and unhelpful. 

The first room we were given was horrific, in a damp dark windowless part of the old hotel.  We changed for a much better double room overlooking the pool.  Rooms were small but warm!  A blessing in January.  

Not much bar action to be had in Jaipur so ended up paying the rather steep price for New Years Eve Gala dinner.  Was very good fun, mainly because there were lots of Indian families booked in, so got an authentic slice of Indian fun! 

Food in restaurant was average, and expensive.   Had a huge problem here with overcharging and incorrect change being given.  Prices kept changing, and I assume waiters pocketing the cash. As a group we complained about this.    

One of our group had someone come in the early morning walk into the room as it was unlocked and steal everything.  So lock your doors at night!! 

Location near the bus station, not too far from the old town.  Would suggest staying somewhere else as there seems to be lots of choice.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r191910665-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452387495","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","1200","18","37","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gampertons","Gampertons","E3E963AD508BC5526825C8E2D0A64A48",,,,,"Gampertons",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

"Disgusting treatment and worst behavior of the staff","1","2022-02","2022-02-25","I arranged a stay at this hotel for my family from 19th Feb to 21st Feb. I thought it would be great as my mom and dad never had a luxury stay. I booked a royal room for them but the hotel staff and the manager especially treated them like sh**.
My experience is stated below:
1) I arrived early and opted for early check in from agoda, but the manager refused to accept it though that option was available.  First he said that rooms are fully booked but later after waiting for 3 hours he offered us to stay. Since we had nowhere to go, we chose to stay.
2) My parents asked them for water to drink so they said that they can offer either mineral water or RO water. But when my parents chose RO water which was free, they didn't provide us. Even after using their phone service they didn't pick up the phone. This happened like 5 to 6 times. 
3) The breakfast I paid for, was not worth at all. My parents had to ask or approach the pantry room after every order? The waiter didn't want to serve our table and he was only interested in serving others.  Trust me it felt like my parents were staying for free.
The only good thing about them is that the rooms are good. I don't know how their website claims to get a trip advisor award but seriously, I I'd have booked an OYO Executive than this.
I am leaving my contact in case if you want any additional input on this review.

I booked through Agoda booking id- 588971625. I came to know on first night that instead of double bed they joined two single beds. I somehow managed to be there on first night and on next morning and I checked out and asked for refund for the 1 night since I stayed only for 1 night. They straightaway denied the refund. First of all they did not provide what was mentioned and then also denied the refund. Pathetic Hotel and Management.

Khamaghani !!!
Thanks for choosing during your recent visit to Jaipur and we appreciate your efforts for spending your valuable feedback on public platform. 
As per your concern would like to inform you that it is no where mentioned on Agoda or any other website that Deluxe room comes with only double bed  as we have  Deluxe room category in Double and Twin and that is why we have mentioned ""Deluxe Room Double/ Twin. We have total 5 Rooms in this category out of which 3 are twin room and 2 are double. 
As per your special request only we have joined the beds for your comfort level. 
Since you stayed for one night and as per your words you managed and did not complaint about anything and on 2nd day you went to reception and asked for refund for last night also. We would have done that if you  do  not stay but sometime we are also bound with our limitation. 
However, our thinking is ""Whomsoever complaint, is our best friend"" and we can assure that no one else  will face such issues.

"Rooftop","5","2021-10","2021-10-23","Hi I had a great time staying at this hotel. Staff was very humble and supporting. They were always eager to help. It was my wife's birthday and they helped me to make it special. I requested them to decorate the room and they happily obliged. Mr Dinesh came forward and took the responsibility for it and he delivered as well.Location of this place is very good as well.it is very near to bus stand and railway station. It's quite peaceful and in the evening they arrange music and singing program by some local artists which totally creates a good atmosphere for dinning. The food was good we had laal maas , junglee roti, matar pulao and murgh masala tikka and the quantity served was also quite enough for two people.. 

My overall rating will be

"A good hotel stay that could be better","4","2025-07","2025-07-17","Overall a pleasant experience at Ramada Jaipur 
+ in general service was friendly, room was clean and mostly functional 
+ everything from housekeeping to restaurant staff to room quality was decent. Manoj at Around the World restaurant was very friendly and proactive - thanks for the thoughtful service. 

- it’s obvious the hotel has some age to it - furnishings are starting to be worn down, eg while most power sockets worked, and some didn’t, even the ones that worked looked like they might come out of the wall if you pull with more force. To be fair I can tell they replaced some parts of the room (the tv looks new) - but could be much better in terms of keeping up room condition. 
- service can be inconsistent - eg. sometimes restaurant staff is very proactive and checks on what you need quickly, sometimes they’re a bit lukewarm on the service; eg once I asked the front desk for something and they forgot about it / didn’t get back to me, but the next day I asked again and a different staff dealt with it immediately.
- beds are soft and I wonder if it’s due to age - something to note if you prefer harder mattresses - but I get it that some people prefer that.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1027166-r1019169235-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452391234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","1200","0","29","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escape05976755618","drib elttil","DD2C0D02A141D1CE235C68FFAE611835",,"294265","Singapore, Singapore","Singapore","Escape05976755618",,,,,,,,"Govind Marg Raja Park, Jaipur 302004 India","Jaipur","India","302004","Rajasthan","Govind Marg","Raja Park","1027166","26.89566","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.82883","Ramada by Wyndham Jaipur","3828","4.4","134","104","289","729","2572","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d1027166-Reviews-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://www.wyndhamhotels.com/ramada/jaipur-india/ramada-jaipur/overview"

"Unexpected ""5 star"" experience ","3","2025-08","2025-08-17","
We landed in Jaipur on 14th August and decided to check-in to the hotel in the evening.
Upon reaching the hotel, I was quite surprised to note that there was no welcome drink offered to any of the guests, which is quite rare for a so-called ""5 star hotel"". 
Shout out to Sachin for being so lovely and carrying out the check-in process smoothly. 
The room was decent, but didn't give the luxurious aura one would expect from the Radisson group of hotels. 
Rom lighting was quite dim, which could pose a problem for those who appreciate well lit rooms. The bedsheets were quite old and stained. The room card kept getting deactivated, which was quite annoying, as we had to contact the front desk everytime we wanted to enter our room.
The breakfast spread was quite good, but the dining area wasn't big enough to accomodate the crowd. Tip: Go early to have a peaceful breakfast otherwise you'd have to wait.
Dinner was quite disappointing, the portion sizes and quality was unjustifiable for the exorbitant prices charged. The rice was undercooked and the dal lacked any flavour.
The pool was completely contradictory to the picture shown on Google images. Incredibly small and didn't have the privacy one would want to have a pleasant time with family. 
The staff who assisted us were helpful and were always at our beck and call. 
Overall it was a first and last time experience.

I had a truly pleasant corporate stay at this hotel during my business trip. The breakfast was delicious, with a good variety to choose from, and being included in the package was a definite plus for a busy work schedule. The staff were extremely friendly, professional, and always ready to assist with a smile, making my stay stress-free after long workdays.

"Avoid this hotel if you want a decent experience in Jaipur. You deserve better.","1","2021-08","2021-08-02","Stay at your own risk!  If you want a pleasant stay and peaceful sleep, then just avoid this hotel!  Some problems at this hotel are as follows:

1. Staff seems untrained and rural. Lacks even basic communication skills.

2. Frequent power trips. Genset may be incapable of bearing AC loads.

3. The Shampoo, soap etc provided is cheap stuff. Better bring your own.

4. No Refrigerator provided in one of our rooms.  While no kettle provided in another room.

5. No regular housekeeping.  They will clean your room only when you leqve your key at reception and specifically ask them to clean your room.

6. Mattresses are cheap and wobbly.  Might give you a backache.

7. No parking available inside hotel.  You will have to park on road side.

8. Avoid their breakfast. long wait for items to arrive.  Average quality food.

9. If you are coming with you driver, then be aware that this hotel doesn't make any arrangements for drivers. Your driver will have to sleep in the car parked on the roadside.

What did we dislike as a family:

1. Extra beds not provided even after having beed booked and paid for in advance.

2.Lack of basic hygiene in hotel staff and inside restaurant.

2. Dirty swimming pool.

3. No adherence to Covid protocol.  Rooms not sanitizer. Sanitizers not offered to guests / visitors.  Several hotel staff wear their masks around their necks.

5. unskilled, rural Staff.

Overall, avoid this hotel if you want a decent experience in Jaipur. You deserve better.

"Clean hotel + room + polite staff uncomfortable atmosphere.","3","2020-03","2020-03-08","Clean, nice accomodation and hotel with accurate description online. 

Only 1 restaurant to eat at. The rooftop restaurant on the photos was not open and there was no evening entertainment. Breakfast adequate, cold breakfast (fair) hot breakfast (good), nice coffee machine. 
The lobby restaurant was clean and nice as seen in the photos, right next to reception.
Dinner, good choice on the menu with cheap/fair prices and good quality food prepared, with  polite waiters. Waiters extremely attentive at times a little to attentive with about five waiting around staring at you throughout the meal. They also are very quick on getting you to order waiting next to you which can feel a little pressurised at times. But very polite and attentive.

On arrival the reception staff were friendly polite and welcoming to the hotel. No complimentary flowers or drinks or special welcome on arrival, just normal check in. Only 2 small bottles of water given as complimentary.

The reception gave a choice of two rooms based on our favourite colours and let us view the rooms before we choose. The room was pretty, clean and tidy as shown on the pictures. Tea and coffee and kettle available in room. Bathroom was clean as shown on photos.  However if you want your room cleaned you need to give your only card to the reception in the morning for them to clean the room. The bedroom mattresses are highly uncomfortable.

The pool was not as pretty as the photos show, very small and outside next to the busy road. Only 2 lounge chairs for the entire hotel to share and 3 alternative tables. There was no food available to eat outside. There are many pool rules. Two of which state you have to wear a costume and swimming hat to use the pool. 

Unfortunately we attended during the Coronavirus scare and the hotel staff wore surgical masks and blue/white gloves for the remainder of our stay, which felt a bit uncomfortable. In the restaurant the staffs gloves were stained and dirty which made me uncomfortable with the level of cleanliness. They would be better not wearing gloves and washing their hands to be clean. The fact that they wore the surgical masks all day, made them void in working and the type they were wearing has been medical stated as not efficient in preventing the spread of the virus. To hear some staff cough under the masks, made me question the health of the staff of the hotel and the level of care they were taking to protect the guests from a chance of it spreading. So it made the stay a very different experience. However the staff once again we're very polite.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r749837210-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"720","126628921","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/8c/34/39/sabrina-f.jpg","960","1","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556sabrinaf","Sabrina F","E2249418E86ABB3020B1934586F39478",,"186217","England, United Kingdom","England","556sabrinaf",,"General Manager","840446819","en","2022-05-28","Laxmi Palace Heritage Boutique Hotel","Dear Guest,

The rooms were lovely and the reception area very atmospheric with its curved seating areas set on each side of the main entrance hall. Unfortunately they are constructing the new metro right outside the front of the hotel, so it's not the prettiest of fron aspects, but this isn't the hotel's fault.  There is a large restaurant and the food looked good, although we didn't eat here. There is a large open-air swimming pool, but it was a bit cold for a dip when we were there in December.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r187702425-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"659","321863814","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/2f/40/86/korosten.jpg","659","17","63","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Korosten","Korosten","8DC2657AC9EC3E39CC4A918DF1C9FE04",,,,,"Korosten",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"
"Misleading but good","3","2013-12","2013-12-12","The pictures given here and on the hotel's website are a bit misleading. The hotel is not a 5star hotel and it doesn't really come close. However, it is still good. Better than most hotels. The hotel staff was very helpful and I was not charged anything extra. Had a bit of a problem and misunderstanding with the restaurant staff but they felt guilty and compensated for it. Overall, a good experience. I will recommend it to everyone, however expect a mid-range hotel, not a 5 star one.

El restaurante lo mejor de todo, muy buena atención por parte del responsable, siempre pendiente de nosotros y comida muy buena.
El personal de recepción parece algo perdido, sin saber muchas cosas del hotel ni de los servicios prestados, hemos pedido mapa y no tenian.

"Pretty Nice..","4","2012-11","2013-01-15","We Stayed here for part of a tour of India we did in November 2012. It was our second hotel experience in India and we were pretty happy with the hotel. One Arrival we were greeted with drinks, flowers necklaces and a blessing. I thought that was a very nice touch. 
Our room was spacious and had lots of light. I did find it difficult to find the correct light switch in the room because there are about 10 different light switches scattered around the room. 

The Bathroom was nice with a large tub and nice HOT water. Just let the hot water run for a few minutes and once it gets hot its Plentiful! However it can take a while to get hot in your room since the boilers are far way. 
The Room was clean and bug free.
The buffet on the 2nd floor was very nice! Good food and good service. Most dishes are not too spicy, however my suggestion to management would be to PLEASE label the Indian spicy dishes with a scale of how hot. One night I got a dish that with one bite I thought I was going to have to cut my tongue out it was so hot. Overall I enjoyed the food here very much. If you have the Breakfast then try the Indian Breakfast here because its good. 
Good place to stay in Jaipur.. easy for Tuk Tuk drivers to find . Just tell them beside the bus station that seemed to work for us.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r149735502-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"365","36597759","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2e/6f/ff/donna-s.jpg","550","169","527","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaS321","Donna S","F8DA5721535059BFA8E191365E2F1BCF",,"154990","Hamilton, Canada","Hamilton","DonnaS321",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

It is also located near the bus station so there are plenty of conveniences around such as bank machines, food vendors and transportation options. The location also seems decent although I was confused walking through the gates so it wasn't terribly far but also wasn't right by your doorstep. On to the negatives, all the electrical plugs seem quite questionnable so it takes some trial and error throughout the room to charge your devices. The spa was incredibly expensive especially since the services were somewhat shady and dirty.

"Good but a few disappointments ","3","2020-02","2020-02-21","The pictures make this hotel look beautiful! The family room on the second floor was nicely decorated and set up with two bathrooms. Very comfortable. However our second room was on first floor and had no glass widow, it was at the end of the hall, very small and old like it was an old closet converted. We asked to be moved and they kindly moved us the next day but we were still on lower floor. The room was older and not as nicely set up. Everything was clean but you could hear a lot of outside noise and hallway noise. We put the bathroom fan to block out noise but it drew in smoke from outside. 
The WiFi was very slowed and repeatedly disconnected.
Location was ok for getting to main sights. Ubers are limited and tuk tuks charge higher prices. 
Breakfast buffet was average not great. 
I would probably stay again if I could get a room on the upper floor.

Simple rooms but it was an actual shower, there was a safe, it was quiet for the most part, and the hotel was so clean that I walked around in my white socks down for breakfast and back up and they were still white. 
The staff was helpful, Uber works there, and the last night we stayed they opened the rooftop restaurant. Didn’t care for the puppet show but it was nice all the same. 
The buffet breakfast and dinner was average but we didn’t get sick and it got us through. It was a reliable safe place to start and end the day. The location was a little sketchy but we made it work. Also there are half a dozen atms within walking distance so that was nice.

"NOT FOREIGNERS FRIENDLY HOTEL","1","2020-01","2020-01-06","We booked this hotel online two weeks before our trip to Jaipur.
They have projected beautifully online. Pictures looked good online. We had spent hours for booking a nice hotel online. After seeing good pictures we booked with our credit card.
But Boy when we arrived at the reception! Our bad day started! Receptionist told us the hidden prices and spoke harsh! Online it showed 2500/- and at reception we were told 5,500/- since we were three, they charged us 1500/- for express person to stay in the same room. We paid 7000/- for a room per night. We stayed here anyway for four nights, because that’s what we had booked online with our credit cards. 
We had booked Royal rooms online, and after entering the rooms, there were nothing Royal about the room, I should have sued this hotel for false advertising. Bathrooms were leaking, bad furnishing, the electricity would go off anytime.
and on the check out, the receptionist asked us to write good review!

As far as your issues are concerned would like to clear that online you'll get different deal wherein hotel booking website are giving huge discounts to customers from their own pocket whereas sometimes rates are different due to browser history, cookies and caches but that doesn't mean we are charging higher rates for foreigner or Indian.

"Average stay; checked out a day early","2","2019-12","2019-12-23","We booked in for a 3 night stay, but ended up staying just for 2. We went in as a family of 4 and there was enough bedding for all of us, but the place was cramped for space and it felt a bit claustrophobic.

The location wasn’t great, as our driver had difficulty finding the place and we never ventured out on foot. Plenty of road noise crept into the room at night and we found it difficult to sleep.

Food was also average and the kids found it too spicy. The free breakfast buffet spread was just passable. 

No door in the shower meant that the water splashed all over the bathroom floor making it completely wet - not a great feeling having wet floor!

The fridge didn’t work, and the staff advised me that all it does is keep it at room temperature (!) without bothering to look it up. Turns out, it was sharing the same plug as the kettle and the previous guest must have swapped it (it was left for me to figure it out)

I lost one day’s payment as we left a day early, but was a good decision in my mind. If you are on a budget, this place may work for you...but I fell for the “heritage” tag and expected a different experience.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r734358112-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452386394","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","1200","4","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahesh_S_Krishnan","Mahesh","CE7CEC88C4C9468971022E0182F31D41",,"255100","Melbourne, Australia","Melbourne","Mahesh_S_Krishnan",,"Manager","741858100","en","2020-01-28","DayTrip28601699076","Dear Guest,

Firstly this hotel has some of the nicest staff ive ever met like mr Subhash like he is not only super kind but also super helpful. Also the food service is 24/7 and I was shocked to learn that as to the fact that other hotels with similar reviews do not provide this.

"Really overpriced, horrific service","1","2012-02","2012-04-07","We stayed here for three nights in February - 2 rooms for 4 people.  The rooms were a bit shabby, we had nails sticking out of our bed head and the fridge was really filfthy and didn't work.  The TV also did not work properly.  The first night we were woken by shouting and yelling in our hallway and also right outside our window.  This was about 5am.  We then heard our phone ring, only to answer it have them hang up in our ear.  I rung the reception and said there was a fire in the adjacent hotel's kitchen and we were to evacuate.  Our friends in the room beside us got no call.  We quickly dressed and took our valuables down to the lobby where there were a few other guests.  Staff were no where to be seen and we eventually went back to our room when we found out it wasn't our hotel.

The next morning - wake up call at 5.25am, same thing - answers but hangs up. This also happens in our friends' room.  I spoke to the Manager later that morning and I doubt he understood me as he just stared blankly.

Third morning, AGAIN!  I dressed this time and walked down to the reception where again I got nothing but blank stares.

Really unimpressed with this hotel - it makes out it is something it isn't.  The staff here were just not inetrested in us at all.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d646146-r127447411-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"412","22286880","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/54/12/20/thehaylinator.jpg","550","70","104","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thehaylinator","thehaylinator","14BFBA39AF404DFD24539603D39EFB34",,"255068","Brisbane, Australia","Brisbane","thehaylinator",,,,,,,,"Station Road Near Central Bus Stand, Jaipur 302001 India","Jaipur","India","302001","Rajasthan","Station Road","Near Central Bus Stand","646146","26.923403","Jaipur, Jaipur District, Rajasthan","75.80163","Fort Chandragupt","223","3.3","41","21","52","59","50","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d646146-Reviews-Fort_Chandragupt-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html","http://fortchandragupt.com/"

Though the hotel looks little old. I suggest this for people travelling with family. The hotel is located very near to all the jaipur attraction.
auto fare I paid
M.I road  - 40 rs
zouhri bazaar - 50 rs.
City palace - 50 rs.  
    the restaurant Maurya was also. they provided compliment breakfast. For budger travellers who feel the restaurant was costly. there is a restaurant apposite to this hotel other side of the road you can get the food packed.

Sehr ekelig- im Bett lag noch die Unterwäsche des Vormieters.

The bed is not that great , the room size is pretty small. We stayed in one of their family rooms it had 2 bathrooms.

Lo staff sempre cortese e disponibile e assolutamente non insistente dal punto di vista mance.
Abbiamo utilizzato anche la piscina che è piccola ma piacevole per rinfrescarsi dalle torride giornate indiane!

However, the hotel is in need of some investment. The air con unit in our first room sounded like a tractor so it wasn’t useable during the night. To their credit the hotel staff were happy to move us the next day to a room that felt more modern, particularly in terms of the A/C. Unfortunately, that room had no hot water so we had to shower in yet another room. Perhaps we were just unlucky!

The location is perfect near to bus stand 1 KM from main market (Pink City) it’s in heart of city. 
I was there on 21st Sep 2019 and loved the ambiance and facilities, fantastically clean the food has great flavor and generous staff is courteous and helpful.
I stayed in family room which is very big including balcony and awesome bathroom.
The pool was breath taking.
We had a pleasant stay and memorable experience. My kid love the ambiance and facilities. Recommend this place for family holiday too.
Parking should be covered as after rain car become dirty.
Overall wonderfully experience.

"La peggior esperienza della mia vita","1","2019-08","2019-08-25","Tralasciando la descrizione della stanza vado dritta al punto e riporto di seguito la mia esperienza perché possa essere da monito per altri viaggiatori.
Ho alloggiato presso la struttura per due notti con il mio fidanzato e una coppia di amici.
Al momento del check out, mentre io saldavo il conto alla reception, il mio ragazzo riscontrava un blocco alla cassaforte in camera dove aveva riposto 1200 euro il giorno prima.
Ha quindi chiamato l’assistenza per aprire la cassetta.. tuttavia all’interno non c’erano più 1200 euro ma 900.. 300 euro erano spariti!! 
Abbiamo denunciato subito l’accaduto al manager che, dopo aver brevemente interrogato il personale di servizio, ci ha detto che non poteva farci nulla.
Siamo, quindi, andati alla polizia e li siamo stati raggiunti dal manager e dai (presunti) proprietari che ci hanno proposto di ridarci tutti i soldi mancanti.
Siamo, dunque, tornati presso la struttura per riavere i nostri soldi.. dopo una scena pietosa i (presunti) proprietari hanno convinto il mio ragazzo a firmare delle carte e gli hanno dato metà dei soldi rubati.
Io non ho firmato nulla (e metà di quei soldi erano i miei) mi sento, pertanto, libera di denunciare in questa sede l’accaduto affinché altri viaggiatori non facciano il nostro stesso errore di confidare nella sicurezza delle cassette e soprattutto della struttura.

Da ultimo segnalo che la struttura, dopo l’accaduto, ha scritto a Booking che non ci eravamo mai presentati (nulla di più falso!!) in modo tale che non potessi fare la mia recensione su quella piattaforma. Ennesima conferma di mala fede. 
Io personalmente consiglio di diffidare.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r702972029-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","20","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilianapR2108MJ","Liliana P","236CB6DCABBA5F1FDF747F2F851EC619",,,,,"lilianapR2108MJ",,"Manager","741857980","en","2020-01-28","DayTrip28601699076","Dear Guest,

Ich ziehe einen Stern ab, weil erstens abends immer mal der Alarm losging, scheinbar ohne Grund. Zudem sind die Zimmer vom Flur her recht hellhörig. Es waren einige laute Italiener dort...
Den Pool konnte ich nicht nutzen, da dort abends immer live Puppentheater aufgeführt wurde. Wenn man dort hin ging wurde man quasi genötigt zuzusehen und dann später etwas zu bezahlen.

El desayuno es de tipo buffet y había como 8 platos calientes diferentes, te chai, café, cereales, etc

Tiene piscina en la planta baja y te proporcionan toallas.

Los platos que pedimos en el restaurante estaban bien de sabor.

El personal tanto de recepción, como de restaurante, es muy agradable.

La habitación como se puede ver en las fotos, estaba decorada con dibujos en las paredes similares a copos de nieve, muy bonitos. El baño estaba muy bien, grifería en muy buen estado y ducha separada del resto, aunque en mi opinión para ser perfecto le faltaría una mampara para evitar salpicar fuera.

La cama era muy cómoda y la ropa de cama estaba muy limpia.

En general el hotel tiene unos altos niveles de limpieza, un día al llegar había tres trabajadores limpiando el techo del pasillo, si se preocupan por el techo imaginad lo que limpiarán.

Habitación muy bonita, amplia y súper limpia.

La piscina del hotel, no es grande pero hace su función, se agradece poder darse un chapuzón.
El restaurante muy bueno, la comida muy rica y variada.

Merece la pena alojarse en este hotel y poder desconectar del caos de Jaipur.

"Lovely hotel","4","2019-04","2019-05-03","We stayed in this hotel for the first 2 nights of our tour of Rajasthan over the Easter break. It was a good choice. We had booked 2 rooms - one got upgraded & unfortunately the other downgraded. However, following a conversation with the reception staff the downgrade was upgraded despite us arriving at 11pm at night & there being limited staff available to prepare the new room. Unfortunately the restaurant was not open even for room service but we were able to get a takeaway delivered & the hotel staff gave us crockery & cutlery without prompting. All a bit manic for a first night but the hotel staff did all they could to help & makae us comfortable. Overall the stay was good & a nice start to our tour.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r671121792-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452386535","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","1200","27","74","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/364KimJ","Kim J","2D31AFB72DD404CA9FD30BC83D4F50D5",,"190737","Bedford, United Kingdom","Bedford","364KimJ",,"General Manager","690530018","en","2019-07-17","DayTrip28601699076","Dear Guest,

"Superb Stay","5","2019-04","2019-04-30","Having stayed in many hotels in India this past month, we have learnt to expect the worse, because most hotels look nothing like the glamorous photos. But this place does! Believe me! The hotel is finished to a high standard, with lovely decor. It's really clean and spacious. The bed is super comfortable, best in India. The pool is great. The staff are so friendly and always helpful. It's a bit back off the main road, so it's quieter, but that also means it's a few kms walk to the local sights. That was ok for us, we like walking, but some people might think it's too far. Plenty of tuktuks around to take you anywhere. Our only negative point is that we didn't get our welcome drink that was on our booking confirmation 😔 Overall, great value hotel, would definitely recommend.

The tiles in the bathroom, selection of paints and motifs, bathroom fittings - the designer made very aesthetic choices. Staff is hospitable and very helpful. But, pool is small considering the number of rooms. The restaurant is small. Can't handle the long weekend traffic.

Alla fine, cenando al ristorante interno (senza birra) vedevamo i camerieri salire per altri ospiti sul roof top! Dunque una certa disorganizzazione che non dovrebbe esserci in un albergo di livello.

I ordered room service, and there was a mistake in my food order, so I requested one of the items be returned. The hotel staff member initially agreed, but then refused, and insisted I sign for the bill, including the item that was supposed to be returned. I had to call the front desk to speak to the hotel manager, to inform management of what happened, and they quickly rectified the situation, taking the food item away, and also taking it off my food bill. 
Now I feel as if the hotel staff is taking retribution on me. I am quite sick, as I ate something here in India that did not agree with my stomach, and my room has run out of toilet paper. I asked a staff member, and they agreed to bring me toilet paper, but after 45 minutes of waiting, no one ever came. (As a reference, during the first two evenings I was here, requests were consistently accommodated within 1-4 minutes, incredibly quickly.) I then contacted the front desk again, to speak to management, once again, and they apologized profusely and said they would have someone bring toilet paper to my room “immediately”. That was over an hour ago. I’m quite positive, given the extreme attention to detail and quick service during my first 2 nights here, that what is happening at the moment, is that the hotel management is directing their staff to carry out instructions for servicing my room, but the staff has essentially gone “on strike” concerning the needs of my room. This is one of the most incredibly, maliciously obnoxious and unprofessional treatments I have ever observed at any hotel, across 45 countries and five continents. I am not only inclined to never again stay at the Laxmi Hotel, but I would advise travelers to avoid this mismanaged hotel at all costs. It is a shame, because my India experience has been stellar thus far, up until this unfortunate event. I won’t be taking it out on India, rather, simply this hotel. Beware the Laxmi Palace Heritage Boutique Hotel.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r649361084-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452390771","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1200","1","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cubantabasco","Eric B","67E3F610E4310AABD911CE664A526BD1",,"40264","Lake Charles, Louisiana","Lake Charles","cubantabasco",,"General Manager","690530530","en","2019-07-17","DayTrip28601699076","Dear Guest,

Hôtel très propre et avec toutes les commodités (eau chaude, cafetière, frigo et même chauffage pour ceux qui sont frileux comme moi).

"Lovely hotel in quiet residential area. Spacious, clean & comfortable rooms. FAB shower","4","2018-12","2019-01-05","I liked the: 
1) Housekeeping - really efficient and hard-working. Despite construction, the rooms and bathrooms were spotless. Laundry was done time with good quality. 
2) Rooms - FAMILY room had 2 full baths, a sitting room with 2 diwans, and a king-size bed. Very comfortable for family of 4 or 5. And DELUXE room had 1 full bath and a king size bed. Both rooms came with good closet space. 
3) The shower was phenomenal - super hot water and very strong pressure. Everyone enjoyed their end-of-day showers after roaming around Jaipur 

Cons (Dec 2018)
There was construction during our stay meant loud grinding noise and dust on the ground (reception) floor. The manager assured us that this would finish soon and would result in a spa and pool. Welcome amenities. 

Location - fairly close to the train station, and about 20min away from City Palace/Jantar Mandar/Hawa Mahal. 

Tips - UBER works really well, and I'd recommend it over the tuk-tuks which charge any amount they feel like.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r643891476-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452392029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","45","214","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerlineB","MerlineB","F831426DFDC8BB4332BB42426FD7C876",,"41889","Wayland, Massachusetts","Wayland","MerlineB",,"General Manager","690530639","en","2019-07-17","DayTrip28601699076","Dear Guest,

"Great Service, Clean Hotel !","4","2018-12","2018-12-17","Easy check-in. Rooms seemed new, clean, all sparkling marble. Entire hotel has beautiful ethnic decor, and yet doesn't have a run-down look and feel that you can get in a ""heritage"" hotel. 
Mohd. Arbaaz, the front desk manager was very professional and flexible. There is some construction going on in a separate portion of the hotel, but guests are isolated from that area, so no bother. The only reason we are giving 1 star less is because the room shower area didn't have enough cover, so the water would spill just a little bit on the floor. That's not too much of an inconvenience, though.

"Not worthy","2","2018-02","2018-04-07","This hotel looks like a home from the outside and the interiors feel the same too. But this place has nothing good to offer except a normal stay. I went here for a weekend with my friend and wasn't satisfied. They didn't help us with a flexible check-in and had to wait in the lobby for a few hours. Later was charged extra for wanting to check-in early. Just the fact that I loved the food here, though we just had a dinner here, as we both were extremely tired after roaming about the city the whole day. But if you are in Jaipur, please try the local cuisine in the local shops, they are lovely.

"Terrible -- Avoid Laxmi Palace","1","2018-02","2018-02-18","Do not be fooled. Laxmi Palace is a one star hotel, likely some of the better reviews are because people are confusing it with a similarly-named (better) hotel. The room we were given was dirty and damp, and everything seemed old and tired. It was bad enough that we paid to move and go elsewhere (eating the room cost), and actually another couple who arrived separately (and were equally unimpressed) did the same (which should give you a sense -- that is n a ne night). I hate to be harsh, but It really did not feel like their heart is in it. For a $1,000 rupee budget option it could be ok (but for the prices they are listing at on booking sites it is ridiculously over-priced, and the pictures make it look way better than it is). Avoid IMO.","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d1138118-r561205356-Laxmi_Palace_Heritage_Boutique_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","2","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaR6656","Jessica R","A714375357FC8F42326335ECEB57EF51",,"191","United States","United States","JessicaR6656",,"General Manager","690530853","en","2019-07-17","DayTrip28601699076","Dear Guest,
